128 HORATII CARMINUM

ODE Vll.

‘Wnan Pompeius at horne again saie in limb and rightsl Pompeius who
shared with me the dangers and the snatched pleasnres oi the campaign under
Brutus. Alter Philippi we separated. Mercury carried me oli in saiety‚ you were -
swept back again into the war. Surelyyou owe Jove a feast oi thanksgiving. My
lawn shall be the soene of the revel. Who would think of sobriety when alost
friend is loundi'

‘Ad Pompeium Varum' Aen: and so the Ode is inscribed in the oldest MSS.
Nothing is known ol Pompeius. He has been by some editors wrongly identified
with Pompeius Grosphus. the rich owner os pastures in Sicily, Epp. r. ra. ar, Od.
a. 16.

Ar what point oi the civil war Pompeius abandoned it and availed himself ol an
offered amnesty, or what interval had elapsed since then, there is no indication.
Horace writes as il he had heard nothing ol his old friend sor some years. and he
has by this time a lawn oi his own on which he oan entertain a guest. The name
oi Pompeius suggests that he may have followed, aster the battle ol Philippi. the
{ortunes ol Sextus Pompeius, who maintained the war by sea against the Triumvirs
till the year ac. 35.
