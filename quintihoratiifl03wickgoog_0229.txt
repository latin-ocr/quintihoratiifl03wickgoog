HORATII CARMINUM

Ab se removisse et virilem
Torvus humi posuisse voltum:
Donec labantes consilio patres ⁴5
Firmaret auctor (nunquam alias dato) ’
Interque maerentes amicos
Egregius properaret exsule
Atqui sciebat quae sibi barbarus
Tortor pararet; non aliter tamen
Dimovit obstantes propinquos
Et populum reditus morantem,
Quam si clientum longa negotia
Diiudicata lite relinqueret,
Tendens Venafranos in agros
Aut Lacedaemonium Tarentum.
