INTRODUCTION TO THE

CARMEN SECULARE.

———————-

Auono the antiquarian and religious revivals oi Augustus, Suetonius
(Aug. gr) mentions the ‘Ludi Seculares'; Dio (54. 18) fixes the date
to the consulship oi C. Furnius and C. Silanus, rac. 17, but beyond
this aud the sact that it proiessed to be their fifth celebration‚ he tells
us nothing. No full account oi them is found earlier than Censorinus ’
(de Die Natali, c. 5 ‘de Seculo’), the writer 'on astrology in the
second hall ol the 3rd century, who is supplemented hy Zosimus
(2. 5), the historian, in the middle oi the 5th century.

Tacitus (Anu. 11. ιι) mentions their repetition in the reign oi
Claudius nu. 46, but declines to describe them, on the ground that
he has already given in the Histories (in one of the Books now lost)
a particular account oi their celebratiou under Domitian, on which
occasion he had had the iullest cognizance oi their details, as being
himself one oi the ‘quindecimviri’ and a praetor.

The games oi which they professed to be the revival went under
the Republic by the name os Tarentini (or Terentini) and Taurii, the
iormer name being connected by all writers with the ‘stagna Tarenti'
or ‘Terenti’ a spot at the north edge oi the Campus Martius, near
the river, once a swamp, and probably a warm spring (see Burn's
Rome and the Campagna, p. 300), the locality oi some os the cere-
monies eveu in Augustus’ celebration3 the latter variously derived,-
by Servius (on Virg. Aen. ε’. 140), from the ‘taureae,’ or sterile cows
which were sacrificed.

Their origin according to some oi the authorities, according to
others their second celebration, was ascribed to Val. Publicola. ΑΙ]
