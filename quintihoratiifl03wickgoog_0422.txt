special relation more eractly than is possible with the caseless intini-
tive. Thus we find with the infinitive, ‘studeo,' Cic.; ‘nitor,' Nep,
‘quaero' Cic.; ‘tend0‚' Liv. ; ‘perg0,' Cic.; ‘persevera' Cic. Many
verbs hesitate between the two constructions, ‘statuo lacere' or ‘ut
faciam,’ ‘prohibeo lacere' or ‘quominus facias! The poets go
beyond the prose writers in this extension, greatly because their
diction substitutos more highly-coloured and metaphorical verbs for
the simpler ones oi prose, ‘ gaudeo,’ ‘ gestio,’ ‘ amo,' ‘ardeo,’ lor ‘ volo,'
etc.; but Livy and Sallust anticipate some of the boldest poetical
applications os this liberty.

It seems useless to seek a tull explanation os each case in the
doctrine that the infinitive was truly a substantive, which involves
the lurther difficulty that we must explain in what relation (or ‘case ')
it stands to the leading verb (see Conington’s note on Virg. G. 1. ²13l·
A Roman poet felt at once the influence os Greek usage, in which
the infinitive never lost its substantival character, andos Latin prece·
dents, which, ii they may be traced ultimately to a similar source, had
yet ceased to be coloured by any consciousness of it. That the inli-
nitive is treated at times by Horace as a substantive is clear from
such sentences as ‘dulce et decorum est pro patria mori,' and lrom its
conjunction with a substantive in the instances quoted below irom
Od. 2. 16. 39, Epp. 1. 19. 9.
