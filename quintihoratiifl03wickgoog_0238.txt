Tun reconciliation os two lovers who heve quarrelled; one is ¹ Lydia: the other
is'not named. The form os the Ode is like the amoebenn eclogucs of Theocritus

His the attraction ol Chlo'e's accomplishments, hers the happiness oi love that is
returned.

His the lordly relenting that offers to east off Chloe and open the gnte again to
Lydia, hers (with one little womanly hit in the impiied comparison os his benuty
with that ol Calais) the passionnte delight, sor all his fickleness and bad temper, to
live and die with him.
