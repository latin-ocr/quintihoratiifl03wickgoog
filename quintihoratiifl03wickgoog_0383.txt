EPODE V..

emma, with her crew of witches‚ Sagana, Veia, and Folia, is engaged in the
task of drawing to her, by spells of magio. a miserable old man named Varus. vv.
1-10‚ the poem opens with the terrified prayers of a boy. who sees dimly that
the hags have some dreadful intent, though he knows not what. 11-14. he is
stripped and set in the midst to await their further purposes. 1544, Canidia gives ’
her orders for the brewing of the magio bowl. 25-28, Sagana sprinkles the house(
with water from Avernus. ²9·40· Veia, meanwhile, is digging in the garden
a hole where. if this spell proves insufficient, the boy is to be buried up to his chin,
and lest to starve. that his marrow and liver may be ingredients in a more potent
philtre. 41-46‚ Folia plays her part in the incantation. What it was is left to
our imagination; we are only told of her power-she could draw the moon and
stars from the sky. 47—60, Canidia. half afraid already that lrer spells are not
successful, appeals to the powers that witness her black arts, that her beloved (aa
old fop. on whom she is made to pour oontempt in her very prayer) may come to
her. 61-82,·he comes not; what has happened? No herb has been omitted.
nothing that could make him forget other charms. Ahar she sees it all. lle is
under the spell of some more skilful witch. He shall not get off, however. She
has a stronger charm yet to try, and heaven and earth shall change places before
she lets his love go? 85-1or‚ the boy understands her, and interrupts the scene
with a burst of despair, in which he threatens his torturers with the vengeanoe of
spirits and men. '

The soene is laid in the interior ol a house in Rome, apparently in the Subura;
see on vv. ²5· 30, 58. Α misunderstanding of v. 43, led Porph. to lay the scene at
Naples.
