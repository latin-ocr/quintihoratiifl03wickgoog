ODE ΙΙΙ.

‘Tur poet isone set apart from his birth hythe Muse's lavour; neither bis mode
os lite nor his objects oi ambition are the same as other men's. For them are the
training and the prizes ol Grecian gemes-the life os a soldier and the triumph on
the Capitol; for him the woods and writers oi Tibur and the glory ol song. 1. too,
am a poet. Rome. tbe mistress ol the world, aclnowledges me as such, and the

voice os envy is still. lt is thy guno Muse; both the inspiration and the popular
ackuowledgment ol it.‘

Compare with the Ode ι. ι, when he looks to Maecenas’ taste to give him the
rank which here he assumes as given him by the voice ot' Rome. There are many
parallelisrus ol thought and expression between the two Odes ; there is the same
division oi the objects ol Greek and Roman ambition (‘sunt quos cuniculo pul·
verern Olympicum), the same description ol the poet’s lile (v. 30 ‘me gelidum
nemus: etc), and olbis hope to be ranked with the Greek lyristspp. ‘Lesboum . .
