LIBER. EPOD. 2.

Aut in reducta valle mugientium Ι
Prospectat errantes greges,

Inutilesque salce ramos amputans
Feliciores inserit,

Aut pressa puris mella condit amphoris, 15
Aut tondet infirmas oves;

Vel cum decorum mitibus pomis caput
Auctumnushgris extulit,

Ut gaudet insitiva decerpens pira,
Certantem et uvam purpurae,

Qua muneretur te, Priape, et te, pater
Silvane, tutor finiumlffl

Libet iacere modo sub‘antiqua ilice,
Modo in tenaci gramine.
