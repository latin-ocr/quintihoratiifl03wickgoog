6 INTRODL'CTION TO THE

and grounds of the keeu interest taken in Parthian affairs, aud of the
stress laid ou the mission of Augustus to restore Roman prestige iu
the East, yet all fall without the period assigned for the composition
of the Odes. The only contemporaneous event of Partlu‘au history
is that which is related by Dio 51. 18, aud by Justinus 42. 5. 5.
Phraates IV, to whom Orodes I had resigned bis throne iu s-c. 38,
after some years of tyranny, provoked his subjecta to the point of
rebellion. He was expelled, aud Tiridates, another member of the
Arsacid house, though his exact relationship to Phraates is unknown,
was put on the throne in his place. aser a short time Phraates was
restored (Justinus adds, by tlre intervention of the Scythians, which
explains probably the allusion of Od. r. 26. 3-5), and Tiridates fled
to seek the protection of Augustus, carrying with him the infant sou
of Phraates. These events are undoubtedly the objects of reference
in Od. r. 26. 5, 2. 2. 17, 3. 8. 19, and very probably also in 1. 34. 14-
26 and 3. 29. 28. 11 we could date them therefore with certainty we
should know the earliest hme at which the first-named Odes at least
could have been written. And it so happens that this would inciden-
tally throw light on one or two more points of Horatian chronology

for 3. 8 is written on an anniversary (it seems almost necessarily the
first anniversary) of Horace's escape from the falling tree. To tir,
therefore, the earliest date of this Ode would determine as much for
the other Odes which refer to the accident, ie. 2. 23 and 3. 4.
Horace's escape again is connected (a. η. 21-30) with Maecenas’
reception in the theatre on his recovery from illness‚ and this in its
turn gives a date of some kind to 1. 2ο. The date, however, ou
which so much depende is not itself quite free from doubt Justinus
says that Tiridates ssed to Augustus, ‘who was at that time fighting in
Spain,' which would fix the date 1222225. Dio, orr the contrary,
narratas the event under the year 3ο, and makes Tiridates find
Augustus in Syria, ou his progress through Asia after the battle of
Actium. This seems more probable in itself than the story of his
joumey to Spain; and the earlier date is the one now generally
accepted. Α confirmation of it is found in Od. 3. 4, which contains
areference to the falling tree, and which yet, both by its relation to
the other Odes at the beginning of Book iii, and hythe allusion of
v. 37 foll, seems to be fixed to a date earlier than ac. 26-25.
Another point of some interest has been supposed to be involved in
the date of Tiridates’ flight. Two of the Odes which referto this
event (3. 8 and 29) speak also of Maecenas as burdeued with cares of
State in a way in which no other Ode speaks 21 him. ‘Mitte civiles
