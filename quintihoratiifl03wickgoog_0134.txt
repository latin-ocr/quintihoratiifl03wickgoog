O D E XXXIV.

Ἰ sumum my old Epicurean doctrine of the ‘⁴ careless” gods (Sat. t. 5. 101).
l have heard thunder not where Lucretius might explain it to me from clashing
clouds, but in a clondless sky. where Icould not bnt recognise it as the rolling of
the chariot wheels that shake all creation. ·It is the same hand that launches
‘'bolts from a clear sky” in human things. that ‘lifts the humble and overthrows

the proud when men least expect it.’

Horace is thinking probably of the challenge with which Lucretius elenchus his
argument that thunder comes from purely natural causes :-

⁸Denique cur nunquam caclo-iacit undique puro
¹Iuppiter in terras fulmen sonitusque profundite-6. 400.

ΤΙκ notable changes of fortune iu his mind at the time are very possibly the vicissi-
tudes of Phraates and Tiridates on the Parthian throne (see Introd. to Odes i-iii, t 8),
though the expressions in vv. 14 foll. are not particular enough to necessitate this
interpretation. The framework of the Ode bears some resemblance to that of
1. tat each centering round a circumstance in the poet's personat experience. 'Ihis
in both cases stands in the middle of the Ode, introduced by the emphatic
‘namque’ (r. 22. 9) : itis the ground of the statements that precede and follow.
What he has-witnessed in this case. and the cause to which alone he can trace it.
justify both the general recantation of stanza ι, and the solution which he gives in
stanza 4 of the difficulty in the human world which seems to him analogous to
the thunder‚ for which no ‘secondary cause’ was to be found, in the material
world.
