MANUSCRIPTS. xix

hardly explains. But a survey of the places where Keller’s readings of
the Odes and Epodes differ from that of other recent editors will
show, l think, that his theory of the relation of the MSS. has not had
any very revolutionary effect upon his text, that he admits conjectures
at least as largely as others, and that his conclusione, however they
were formed, are supported generally by evidence from the Scholia or
quotations, or by consideratione of style, metre‚ and the like ¹.

Before we leave the MSS. it may be the place to say a few words
upon two subjeets which present themselves very early to the reader
, of any notes upon Horace.

1. The first has been glanced at already. Ido not know -that
ceryictural emendatam has really been exceptionally busy upon Horace's
text That the two are specially associated in the minds of general
readers is due doubtless‚ in a greatmeasure, to their greater familiarity
with the author, to the brilliancy of the conjectures themselves, the
contributions of a long series of the greatest scholars from the
Renaissance onwards, particularly perhaps to the unrivalled power,
learning, and eloquence with which our greatest English scholar
recommended the method and its results in his edition of the poet.
There was something however in the nature of the critical evidence
on which Horace's text rests which made conjectural emendation,
if not specially necessary, at least specially tempting. Necessary of
course it was not in the sense in which it is necessary in the text
of Aeschylus or of Lucretius, to restore sense or metre in a chaos;
but in a way the multiplicity of MSS. tempts us to do for one author
what the poverty of MSS. almost compels us to do sor another.
A variety of readings, all consistent with metre and intelligible, and
all testing on fairly equal MS. testimony, must imply the hand of one
or more emenders of the text at an early period. Itis a natural
interpretation to assume in such a case that all alilre are attempta,
