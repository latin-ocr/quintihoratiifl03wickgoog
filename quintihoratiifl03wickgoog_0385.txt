At expedita Sagana per totam domum ²⁵
Spargens Avernales aquas
Horret capillis ut marinus asperis

point as completing the whole resem-
blance οἰ the boar to Sagana bustling
about. It has the more place, as we
have had no definite verb to express her
movements.

that we require rather an epithet to
