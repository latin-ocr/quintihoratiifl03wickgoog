ODEXI.

Ο Mmcunr and my lym, teaeh me some strain that will wia the obdurate ear of
Lyde. She is like a young unbroken colt; but music has made tigers and forest
trees an'd rivers stay to listen. It has tnmed Cerberus. and beguiled the pain of·
Ixion and Tityus and the Danaids with their leaking pitchers. Let Lyde hear
their tale—how they slew their husbands, all save one—their punishment. and
Hypermuestra’s undying glory.

Lyde is warned not ‘placito pugnare amori’ by the story of the Danaids and ’
their punishment, and the noble exception of Hypermnestra. The application of
the story is not very close. The form of the Ode seems to be a nearer imitation
than usual of the construction of an Ode of Pindar; the commeneement by an
invocation of Mercury aud the lyre; the accidental way in which, through the
recountal of the feats of music, the Danaids are introduced; the myth told at
length, but lest to be applied hy the readcr's wit. -Compare 3. 3 and 3. η.

For the story of the Danaids read Aesch. Pr. V. 853-869 and Ov, Her. 14
‘Hypermnestra Lynceo: which contains frequent reminiscences and expressions of
passages in this Ode. Compare vv. 3. 4 ‘Clausa domo teneor gravibusque coer·
cita vinclis: Est mihi supplicii causa fuisse piam,¹ etc. with vv. 45. 46 of the Ode,
vv. 35. 36 with 41 foll.. vv. 73, 74 ‘Surge age, Belide. de tot modo fratribus unus;
Nox tibi, ni properas, ista perennis erit‚’ with vv. 37, 38‚andvv.127-130 with
v. 51,see note.

Ritter suggests that thc story would be especially familiar to the Roman public
at the time when Horace was writing these Odes, from the fact that a group of the
Danaids formed a chief feature in the portico of the temple of Apollo on the Pala-
tine, which Augustus dedicatedin nc. 28 (see Od. 1. 31). Prop. 3. ²3· 4, Ov. A. A.
