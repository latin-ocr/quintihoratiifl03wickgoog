384 INDEX 01} METRES.

θεοῖσιν, 'Ille mi par esse deo videtur? ‘nze lengthening of the short
syllable in π. ⁶. η, ‘Angulus ridet, ubi non Hymettos is perhaps
u traee of the feeling that, ns the first syllable os the dactyl, it had the
metrical necent upon it⁴

The caesurn fans commonly. in the first three Books, aster the finh
syllabley ‘Iam szzis terris,¹ though it is found, [ποι-η time ιο time, after
the sixth, ‘Quem virum sut heroa.¹ In the earm* Sec. and the
Fourth Book, Horzce returns in this point to the use of Catullus nnd
the Greek, and employs the second caesura frequently. 1n either the
three Sapphie Odes os Book Four together, or in the Carm. Sec.
alone, there are twice as many instnnees os it ns in the twenty-one
Odes of the earlier Books.

There is no synaphea, but hypermetrie syllables ure occasionany
elided at the end ol* an the first three verses os {he stnnn (a. ι, 18. 2.
1⁶. 34, 4. ². υ, ²3, C. S. ⁴⁷)· By S2ppho the Adonin was treated
ns is it scanned continuously with the verse before, and this use ie
preserved in Horace ιο sorne extent, τι word being nt times divided
between them (ι. 2. 19, ι. 25. Π, ². 16. 7). On the other hand, we

find a hiatus at times, u in r. z< 47 ‘Neve te uostris vitiis iniquum
Ocior aura!

ᾗ 4. Iambr‘c metrer.

Os these two occur iu Horace :—

(1) The common Semnus or Iambie Trimeter (sor the name
see Ars Poet. ²5²) in Epod. ¹⁷·

(2) Couplets of the Senarius nnd m lambio Dimeter in Ep0d⁴
r-ro.

Home does not observe the lnw os the Greek 'rx-agie Semi-ius in
respect of ² short syllable before a final cretic; see ιε. Epod. 1. 27
and ²9-

Three instances occur os au apparent anapaest in the fisth place:
Epod. ι. 35 ‘laquem' 5. 79 ¹inserius,' 11. ²³ ‘mulierculan but
Meineke rightly explained thern as insunces os synizesis, or using
e and ι’ as semivowels, aster the malogy of ‘aurea' in Virg. Aen.
r. ⁶9⁸» and os ‘consilium' and ‘principium' in Od. 3. 4. 4¹ and
3. ⁶. ⁶.

Car-rm. See), and rr ont os ¹⁷ Epodes.

Of the remaining metres. one or at the rnost two or three
specimens exist, which are to be viewed uther, ns Mr. Munm
remarks, as experiments.
