1. The most obvious instance, perhaps. is the disposition os the
four Odes [or the sake os which we my say the Book was oomposed.
They nand in two pain (evidently not on any chronological ground,
sor Ode ⁶ must be at least {wo years earlier than any oi them) at (he
beginning of the Book (aster a prelude, which vill be uou'eed pre—

one os the young prinees; w ihzt any praises os the inter may seem
