Lm. 1. on. 28. 83

‘doctus iuvenis' which was the talk of Tarentum on some occasion when Horace
was staying there. He has been drowned on the Illyrian shore (v. π), but his
shade revisits Tarentum. apostrophizes Archytas, whose tomb is placed there, and
appearing to a sailor, bids him stop on his voyage to throw dust on its unburied
corpse as he hopes for a prosperous return to more western waters (v. 26).

Others have supposed that the imaginary corpse is Horace’s own. He had
been nearly lost at sea once off Cape Palinurus (od. 3. 4, 28). The soenery of
this Ode will hardly suit that ocmsion: but the event may have filled his mind
with thoughts and images of shipwreck.

ln my notes I have inclined to Dillenburger's interpretation, not as a completely
satisfactory one, but as less far-fetched than most, and involviug fewer difficulties,
and as giving the Ode a thoronghly Horatian tone. That Archytas huda tomb
on the sea-coast, near Mount Garganus, is not a fact of history. nor in any way less
an assumption of the interpreter than that he was drowned and cast ashore there.

We may notice that Horace seems to have been interested in the Pythagorean
doctrines, and especially in that of Metempsycbosis, and yet not disinclined to
speak playfully of them, Epod. 15· ar, Epp. a. 1. 52, S. a. 6. 62. He ranks
Pythagoras with Socrates and Plato as representing the great teachers of Greek
philosophy. S. 2. 4. 3.

Archytas was a Greek of Tarentum, and livedin the fourth century nc. Like
the rest of the Pythagorean school of philosophers he was a great matbematician.
