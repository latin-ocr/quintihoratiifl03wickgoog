LIB Ι. OD. 6.

ODE VI.

‘Hercle exploits require a Homer to sing cf thern.’ says Horace, and so gives
Agrippa the lyric glory that (it would seem) he has asked for, while professing to
leave the task of celebrating such exploits to the epic genius of Varius. For
panegyric cast in the same form compare Od. a. 12 and 4. a.

The Ode is addressed to M. Vipsanius Agrippa, me friend and connsellor of
Augustus, and the greatest commender of his reign. He finally defeated Sextus
Pompeius at Naulochos in tac. 36, and commanded at Actium in ac. 31. After
the death of Marcellus (and consequently‚ it would seem. after the publication cf
this Ode) he was married by Augustus to his daughter Julia (uc. 21); was asso-
ciated with him (rac.18) in the Tribunitian power, and was looked upon as his
intended successor. He died four years before Horace. in uc. η. Horace speaks
of his popularityin Sat. a. 3. ¹⁸55 of his subjugation of the Cantabri in Epp. 1. 12.
26: of his engineering exploit of turning the Lucrine lake into charbem, though
without mentioning his name, in A. P. 63.
