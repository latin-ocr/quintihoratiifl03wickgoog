ODE IX.

‘Tua most continuans mins, the longest wintere, end at last. Let not your
grief for Mystes alone be unending‚ Valgius. Not even Nestor grieved inconsol-
ably for the son of his old age, nor his parents and sisters for the blooming
Troilus. ’Tis time to oense from wallings more womanly than theirs, and to sing
of Caesar‘s triumphs!

The Ode is addressed to C. Valgius Rufus. a poet whose elegies are referred to
and quoted by Servius on Virg. E. 7. aa. and Aen. 11. 457. The scattered and
doubtful hints which can be gleaned about him will be found in the Dict. Biog.
He stands in Sat. 1. ro. 82 with Varius, Maecenas, Virgil, and the other select few
for whose literary approbation Horace cares. Tm Scholiasta speak of him as a
⁸ Consularis‚' and the name occurs in the Consular Fasti, rac. ra.

The date of the Ode has been a subject of controversy. Vv. 19, ao can hardly be
unconnected with Virgil’s lines, G. 3. 30 foll. :-

‘Addam urbes Asiae domitas pulsumque Niphaten,
Fidentemque fuga Parthum versisque sagittis.
Et duo rapta manu diverso ex hoste tropaea,

. Bisque triumphatas utroque ab litore gentes!

In both cases one set of interpretem see a reference to the year ac. ro, when
Angustus was himself in Asia, and Tiberius. under his orders, advanced into
Armenia, and replaced Tigranes on the throne of that country, and alarmed
Phraates into restoring the prisoners and standards taken at Chartae. It is
impossible, however¹ in these poetical references to Augustus' exploits to dis·
entangle anticipation from history or the hyperbolical dress of historical fact.
Horace's language will be sufficientiy accounted for by Virgil’s so that, if with
Heyne we think it unnecessary to imagine that Virgil inserted the lines in question
ten years after the composition of the Georgics and in the year before his death.
we shall think it equally unnecessary to set aside‚ for the sake of this Ode, 1² ranke’s
judgment, that the three Books were complete in ac. ²3· See Introd. to Books iiii,
