LIB. 111. OD. 25

Dicam insigne recens adhuc
lndictum ore alio. Non secus in iugis
Exsomnis stupet Euias
Hebrum prospiciens et nive candidam ιο

Lustratam Rhodopen, ut mihi devio
Ripas et vacuum nemus
Mirari libet. O Naiadum potens
Baccharumque valentium
Proceras manibus vertere fraxinos,
Nil parvum aut humili modo,
Nil mortale loquar. Dulce periculum est,
Ο Lenaee, sequi deum
Cingentem viridi tempora pampino. ιο
