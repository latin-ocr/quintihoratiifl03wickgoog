LIBER SECUNDUS.

ODE I.

‘Pomro is writing the tale ot the civil wars, a difficult aud delicate taslr. We
can afford to let even his tragedies wait nubile, till the great and brave orator of
the lorum and the senate, and the conqueror oi Illyria. bas given us bis history.
In our eagerness we seem already to bear the trumpets and see tbe llashing amour,
to hear him reading to us of the sall oi cbiet‘tains and the conquest oi all the world
save Cato's stubbom soul. Ay, Jugurthu is avenged nowl What land or senis
not red with the blood os our fratricidal wara? But stay, my Musa, these are uo
uemes t'or you.' ’

There is nothing to hx very definitely the date oi the Ode. The expressions ot
the two first stamas. ‘noudum expiatis: ‘cineri doloso: perhaps attract it to the
Odes (such as 1. a and 14) which dwell mure ou the troubles irom which the State
had already escaped, than on the new and peuceiul order on which it had entered.
Augustus is not mentioned. Pollio had not sided with bitu, and bad certainly been
a friend os M. Antony. But the Ode expresses. as strongly as Od. 1. a. that weari-
uess os bloodshod which bad induoed men to acquiesce in the rnle ol one.

C. Asinius Pollio, the friend and supportes οἰ Julius Caesar, having passed

’ through the Consulship in nc. 40 (Virg. Ε. 4), and won the honours ol n triumph
sorbis campaign against the Illyrisos (ib. 8. 6-13).witbdrew from public lise, and,
in the subsequent struggle between Antouy and Octavius, remained honourably
neutral. He was a magnificent patronos literature. aud is famousas having estab-
lished the first public library at Rome out oi the spoils οἰ bis Illyrian campaign.
He was also one οἰ the most accomplished nien ol the age. Catullus (12. 9) speaks

’ os him in his youth as 'leporum Disertus puer et facetiarum! He is ranked among

the great orators by Quintilian (ro. 1. ¹¹3). Seneca (Epist. 100), and Tacitus (De Or.
38). His tragedias are spoken os in high tersus by Virgil (Ε. 8. 10 ‘sola Sophocleo
tua carmina digne cothurno’) and Horace (stt. r. 10. 4²)· His history ol the
civil wars, from rac. 60 to the establishment ot' Augu stus' power, is referred to by

Tacitus (Anu. 4. 34), Suetonius (Jul. Caes. 30).
We may notice the skill with which Pollio‘s vadum accomplisbmeuts are worked

incidentnlly into the Ode.
