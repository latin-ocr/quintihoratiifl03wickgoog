IN THE ODES. 377

that seem to accompany its mention and by its recurrence among the “

reminiscences of the poet’s own life in the Epistles. That amere
literary reminiscence, an echo of his amatory poems rather than of
his feelingS, is intended seems unlikely in the absence of the name
from all his early poems. The exception, however, tells rather against
than for the reality of the personages who are not similarly recalled ;
and Buttmann draws attention to the fact that this one unknown
person who seems more than a shadow is the subject only of allusion,
not of a substantive poem.

What has been said will obviously not apply with equal force to
the Epodes, where, in idea at least, personality is the essence of the
poem. The introduction of Horace's own name, as in Epod. 15, and
the pursuance of his attach upon Canidia through three Epodes and
three Satires seem to indicate more real and definite objects. But
the use of poetical names for characters who have no existence save

at the moment begins doubtless in the Epodes, as do other features
of the Odes.

pose, effort, beginning, etc, and the negation of any of these (¹ pos·

the simple verbs which express the allowing another, or influencing
him, to do or abstain from doing something (¹ sino,' ‘patior,' ‘iubeo,'
‘doceo,’ ‘cogo’ ‘veto,' ‘prohibeo' etc). There is a tendency, how·
ever, even in the most classical prose writers to extend the first at
least of these two classes by including verbs which do not properly
require any such complement, and which therefore, if any further
definition of their scope or purpose were needed, would in strictness
have found it rather by means either of some subordinate clause or of
one of those substantival forms of the verb which could indicate its
