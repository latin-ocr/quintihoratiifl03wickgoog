Ο DE XXXII.

‘Tm call on us sora song. Come, my lyre, I have drawn strains from thee
‚before which, light though they be. will not soon die: answer now with such
music sor Roman ears as thou yieldedst os old to Alcaeus. Hewas a patriot anda
warrior, yet amidst his wars and shipwreclrs he found time to sing oi wine and
love. Ο lyre, the delight oi gods. the solace os toil, help me too whenever 1 duly

eall 011 thee.' ·

It is not nnlikely that the Ode refers to some request oi Augustus or Maecenas
ior a poem os a graver cast: Ritter thinks the six stately Alcaic Odes which stand
at the beginning oi Book iii. There is an appearance of reality in the appeal
oi the first stanza, andin the pains which he takes to point out that lyrics on
Lycus’ black hair were not inconsistent in Alcaens' case with civic zeni and
soldierly contage. It is written, like Od. 1. ι, a. ao, 3. 30, when Horace had
become easy as to his own powers and their recognition by the world. See.
