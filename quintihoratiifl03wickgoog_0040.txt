ODES, BOOKS 1-111. 3

we are on less safe ground. Α very few can be fixed with exactness
Such are 1. 31, which is written for the dedication of the temple of
Apollo Palatinus in sc. 283 a. 4, which Horace dates himself in
nc. 25, by reference to his own age; 1. 24 and 3. 14, both of which
are fixed to nc. 24, the one by the known date of the death of Quin·
tilius, the other by the return of Augustus from Spain. We may
perhaps add a few, though in their case of course more latitude must

which can themselves be dated Such are 1. 35, which represents
Augustus as on the point of starting for Britain, a purpose for which
we know that he set out from Rome in nc. 27 (see lntrod. to that
Ode, Dio 53. aa, 25); and 1. 29, which seems to refer to prepara·
tions more or less immediately preceding Aelius Gallus' expedition
into Arabia Felix in nc. 24. Such again are the Odes (a. 15 and 3.
6) in which we can hardly doubt the reference to the restoration of
temples which Augustus undertook in the year aa.

the date of single Odes have to lean agood deal on Horace’s references
to events on the frontier and beyond it, movements of the Cantabrian,
the Scythian, the Parthian ln estimating the value of these it is of
course necessary to be sure of the nature of the allusion. We are in
danger of confusing poetry with history when we look too closely into
every mention of Dacian or lndian and search the pages of Dio or
Strabo for some detail that will exactly suit it Horace's verses are
full of the feeling of the greatness of the Roman empire, the remote·
ness of its frontiers, the immense charge which Caesar has taken on
himself. And the names of distant and unknown places and tribes
had a spell in ancient times which they have lost in days of maps and
geography. Even when we oorne to rnore definite references, as
those to the quarrels of Phraates and Tiridates, or to the frequent
risings of the Cantabri, though we have here ample ground for dating
generally the period during the course of which the poems must have
been composed, and exactly, if we know the date of a special event
referred t0, the year before which the particular poem could not have
been composed, we yet soon get to the point where the event has
become a standing illustration of the vicissitudes of fortune or a
statesman’s anxieties,a poetical commonplace which may recur till it
is supplanted by some fresh circumstance which strikes the poet's
imagination.

To this it must be added that the foreign history of the time it
