xviii INTRODUCTION.

(eg. ¹videri,’ against the nie-tre in Epod. 1⁶. η), little or no proof
os alteration on rhetorical or general grounds. ln this class Hoider
places, ol the MSS. named above, A, α (in respect os most rendings),
D, γ, and, though not on sn equality with these, r.

The second class is supposed to show the concedens os nn esu-ly
and intelligent emender. 'sliat such δωρθαπιί existed in early times is
stated by the Pseudo-Acron on Ars Poet. ³⁴5· And the nsme os
one is found in the inscription which appears, in slightly-different
terins, ht the end of the Epodes in λ, Ι, Reg„ g. ‘Vettius Ager-ius
Basilius Mavortius Vr C. et inl. (vir clarissimus et inlustris) Excom.
Dom. excons. ord. (Excomite Domestico, exconsule ordinario) legi et
ut potui emendavi, conferente mihi magistro Felice oratore urbis
Rornae! Felix is not known, but Mavortius was consul in the year
ω). 527Δ Asterius, consul ⁴94· is similarly connected with the his-
tory oi the text of Virgil. Bentley had treated this Mavortia recen-
sion as the ultimate point to which the oldest MSS. might be expected
to take us back> Holder treats it rather as the first, though not the
worst, source os systematic corruption. In the class which he thinks
owe their peculisi-ities to this editing, he places B, V, with g, and in
respect os some οἱ their reudings, Α, ιι, and λ, the first two os these
being in respect oi* much of their text affiliated to class one, the third
to class three*

The third class (in which mni« F (εφψ), 2¹ (ΞΜ), ιι, η, 0, and
others) is held to be oi less value, both as having been derived, in
the first instance, from more faulty originals, und ns bearing signs
os luter and less intelligent correction.

These conclusions are based upon such an elaborate study of the
MSS. that it is impossible to criticise them in the absence of the i'ull
explanation and detailcd evidence which are still promised. But it
may be observed that the tie which is irnsgined between the MSS.
which are classed together is consessedly a loose one. Room is lest
sor considerable influenoe ol MSS. ot· one class upon those of another*
As a fact, there are very few cases indeed of doubtful reading where
the division os testimony eorresponds at all exact-ly to the three classes.
Doubtless there are n {ew crucial passages where the valuc which is
set on such MSS. ns Vor Β goes tar to decide the choice of u reading,
md there must be more cases still where the instinctive feeling os the
u'ustwunhiness os particular MSS. on particular points which comes
from long intercourse with them, but which no ‘apparatus criticus¹ will
convey to ι render, hns guided Keller or Holder to a conclusion which
the mere inspection of the list of MSS. on oue side and the other
