nvnsx or Marnas. 383

are two other instances where a preposition at the beginning of a
composite word gives a quasi-caesura, r. 16. ar ‘Hostile aratrum
exercitus insolens,' 1. 37. 5 ‘Antehac nefas depromere Caecubum!
Horace seems to have paid great attention to the rhythm of verse β,
excluding, and more carefully in his later poems, all conjunctions of
words which did not by their accent counteract that natural sameness
of movement which we find undisguised in Alcaeus, λαῖφος δὲ πᾶν
(ἀδηλον ἤδη, etc. No quadrisyllabic ending or beginning is found in
Book iv except of the forms of ‘Nomen beati qui Deorum' and
‘Consulque non unius anni! Verses of the form of ‘ Gaudes, apricos
necte flores’ (1. 26. 7) are found only in 1. 16, 26, 29, 35, and a. 1,
3, 13,14, 19. ‘Hunc Lesbio sacrare plectro' in 1. 26. 11 is unique.
It was the occurrence ol these two verses in 1. 26, and of the verse
‘Alcaee plectro dura navis’ in a. 13, that called Lachmann's attention
to the wrong date assigned by Franke, on Justinus’ authority, to the
quarrel of Phraates and Tiridates, and consequently to these Odes,
which thus became specimens ol Horace's later instead olbis earlier
handiwork, see Introd. to Books i·iii, ξ 8.

There is no synaphea between the verses of the stanza, but Horace
twice allows an elision of a hypermetric syllable at the end of the
third verse, a. 3. 27 and 3. ²9· 35. There is an analogous licence
taken in the Asclepiad metre in 4. 1. 35, and Virgil allows it in the
hexameter, Georg. 1. 195, etc.

ξ 3. The Sappho stanza is found in twenty-five Odes :-
1. a, 10, 12, 20, aa, 25, 30, 32, 383
2. a, 4, 6, 8, 10, 163
3.8,11,14,18,ao,22,27;
4· 2, ⁶, 115
and in the Carm. Sec. ,
1t employs two kinds of verse, the lesser Sapphie, which is repeated
three times-
----- υυ-υ-Ὰ
and the Adonic-

The materiale of the rhythm in this are the same as in the Alcaic.
It is a sequence of trochees and dactyls This is obscured in Horace,
(1) by his excluding the trochee absolutely from the second place,
where it is often found in Sapph0, and in her first Latin imitator,
Catullus, al δὲ μὴ φιλεῖ ταχέως padua, ‘Pauca nuntiate meae puellae ' ;
(2) by his escheving the break before the dactyl, φαίνεταί μοι :ivor letor
