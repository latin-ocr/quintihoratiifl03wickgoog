ODE XXIV.

Or the person whose death is the subject of this Ode we know nothing but what

is contained in the statement of the Chronicon of Eusebius (nn. 264-340), which,
opposite the year n.v.c. 730, ac. ²4· has (in the Latin version of Jeromei ⁴ Quin-
tilius Cremonensis Vergilii et Horatii familiaris moritur! We may notice that the
mention of Cremona makes him a neighbour of Virgil. The Scholiasts on Horace
call him Quintilius Varus, and add that he was a Roman knight, identifying him
with the Quintilius of Α. P. 43⁸· see on v. 8, and with Varus of Od. 1. 18.
- The Ode is not merely, as Porph. describes it·0privoa in Quintilium sodalem Ver·
gilii.¹ Τὴο Pseudo-Aer. characterizes it more justly, ‘Consolatur Vergilium impa-
, tientes amici sui mortem lugentem! Horace's feeling is for Virgil as much asfor
their common friend. From this point of view we must be struck by the delicscy
of the 'consolation’ He justifies Virgil’s grief, he shares it. ‘He too will join in
the dirge; Quintilius is gone, the peerless, the soul of modesty, honour, justice, and
truthl All good men weep; aud who has greater right to weep than Virgil,
whose piety and trustfulness the gods have so hardly rewarded'? Only at last,
when he has opened his friend's beart by his expression of sympathy, does he
venture on a hint, not perhaps of comfort, but of seh-restraint. 'After all, no
laments, though sweeter than Orpheus, no prayers‚ will reach the dead. It is a cruel
fate¹ patience only will lighten what may not be cured’

It would seem, if Donatus be giving a genuine trait of Virgil in his Life, c. 18,
that Horace is recalling his friend tobis own philosophy for consolation: ‘Solitus
erat dicere nullam virtutem commodiorem homini esse patientia, ac nullam adeo
asperam esse fortunam quam prudenter patiendo vir fortis non vincat!
