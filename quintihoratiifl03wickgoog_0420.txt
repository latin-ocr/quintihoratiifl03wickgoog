of the name to a special character, us ⁴Cyrus,' 1. ¹⁷- 25, 1. 33.

1, 3* 19. 2⁶, 4. u. ²¹3 ¹Lyce,' ³- ιο, and 4. 13; but this last
instance (viewed in light os the gener-al relation of Book iv. ω the
earlier Eooks) points to the explanation that it is in all enses a
litemry identity, a reminiscence of a previous poem, not os a living
person. On the other hand, the same name is at times given
to people os such different characters or ages, that those who would
give them real existence are obliged to recognise more than one owner
ol* the name: cp. the Phyllis os ι. ⁴ and 4. rr, the Chloris os ε. ⁵
and 3. 15, the Lalage os 1. η and a. 5, not to shy the Glycera
os ι. 30 and r. 33. There are cases, doubuess, where a reality is
given to unknown names by their being brought into close relation
with real persons and events such as ulyxes: the lost friend os
Valgius, in αι 9; vainans: who is to rival Bassus in dmughts of
wine at the feast on Numida's return, 1. 3⁶ ; ὈΙγοετι,’ to whom
Tibullus is supposed to write piteous elegies, ι. 33. In this last case
we note that Glycera is not a name that occurs in Tibullus' extant
elegies, which suggests the possibility that even in such instances as
these, though the reference be real, the name may be fictitious. This
is of course the ultimate refuge os those who would see in the hemines
os the Odes real persons. The names they give up; but Horace, it
is argued, may have concealed the true names, as tradition tells us
(see π. 12 Introd.) Catullus eoneealed the name of Clodia under that
os Lesbia, Propertius that os Hostia under that os Cynthia, Tibullus
that os Plania under that os Delia, etc.; nnd Home himself, in the
Epodes and Satires, the name of Grntidia under that of Canidia ς
it is even added (see ibid.) the narne of Terentiu, Mnecenas' wife,
under that os Licymnia The possibility cannot be denied, but the
suggestion leaves us rnuch where we were ns to any canon by which
to know true persons from imaginary ones. No tradition helps us,
and Estre observes that the only instances of such concealment os
real names sor which any tradition vouches are insuaves where the
true and salse namessswere metrically equiitalent, a requiremerit which
makes havoc ol* several schemes oi' ‘amores Horatius-i) We should
still hzve to leave as the representatives os different persons names
which suit almost every metrical (out ol' two, three¹ or four
syllables.

There is one unknown name in the 0des, that of Cinara (Od. 4.
r. 4, ⁴> ¹3- ar, n, Epp. r. 7. 28, r. η. 33), which is perhaps
redeerned lrom this shadowy existence, both by the persona] seelings
