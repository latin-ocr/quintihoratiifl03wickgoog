ODE XIX.

Tae poet imagines himself (vv. 1-4) to heve come. while wandering in the hills.
on Bacchus amidst the Nymphs end Satyrs. He describes dramatically (es though
he selt them at the moment) the etiects of the sight: the fresh terror (χαλεποὶ rt
θεοὶ φαίνεσθαι ἐναργεῖς, Hom. ΙΙ.1ο. 131), the rush os inspiration3 delightlul, yet
hals painsul, from its tumultuous excitement. Then he finds the wey of reliel'.
He may sing the praises os Bacchus: os his power to bless those whom he loved
end destroy his enemies ; his power over inanimate nature, over noxious herste.
over the giants. over the monsters of Hades.

Compare Od. 3. 25. They both seem to be attempts to catch something of the
inspiration oia Greek dithyramb. That Ode has a purpose: the present one is
a mere study. There is no reason to believe that it is a reproduction os any single
original. The art of its composition. the climax through which the celebretion os
Bacchus’ triumph rises‚ and the studiedly quiet conclusion aster the abrupt bursts
ol the beginning. as though the strained mind had found relies and the 'turbida
laetitia' run itselt clear, are Horatian rather than Greek.

Dillr. suggests that Horace had been lately reading Euripides‘ Bacchae. That
he had read it is pretty certain.
