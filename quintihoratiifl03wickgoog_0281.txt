Dicam insigne recens adhuc

Indictum ore alio. Non secus in iugis
Exsomnis stupet Euias

Hebrum prospiciens et nive candidam ιο
Thracen ac pede barbaro

Lustratam Rhodopen, ut mihi devio
Ripas et vacuum nemus

Mirari libet. ONatadum potens
Baccharumque valentium

Proceras manibus vertere fraxinos,
Nil parvum aut humili modo,

Nil mortale loquar. Dulce periculum est,
Ο Lenaee, sequi deum

Cingentem viridi tempora pampino. ιο
