4 INTRODUCTION TO THE

imperfectly known to ua, and that some uncertainty hangs over the
dates of several of those events which are known.

ξε. It may be convenient and may save some repetitions to give
shortly in this place the few facts which are known with respect to the
Cantabriam, the Dacians and Scythiam, and the Parthiam, to which,
if to any known historical events, allusions in these Books must have
reference.

lo. The Cantabri, a trrbe bring in the mountains of the northern
coast of Spain, are named by Dio (51. ao), with their neighbours the
Astures, as in arms against Rome at the time of the general paci-
fication in nc 29, and as being conquered in that year by Statilius
Taurus. The next mention of them is in nc. 26 (Dio 53. 25), in
which year the news of their rising reached Augustus in Gaul, and
diverted him (see above, ξ 3) from his intended expedition to Britain.

He was commanding in person against them in ac. 25, but fell ill and
was detained at Tarraco for some months. In the meantime the war

was concluded by C. Antistius and T. Carisius, his ‘ legati! Augustus
himself returned horne in nc. 24. ln the same year they rose again
(Dio 53. 28) and seized by stratagem and killed some Roman soldicrs,
but were again put down by L. Aemilius.

. The expressions of Od a. 6. a ‘Cantabrum indoctum iuga ferre
nostra,’ and a. ιι. ι ‘Quid bellicosus Cantaber . . ‚cogitet' would be
intelligible at any time during this period, and as each conquest would
be thought final till the next rising, there is nothing in the words of
3. 8. ar ( ‘Servit Hispanae vetus hostis orae Cantaber sera domitus
catena ¹) to fix them necessarily to a single date. Other considerations
perhaps place the Ode, as we shall see, either in nc. 29 or in 25.

The final subjugation of the Cantabri by Agrippa in nc. 19 (Dio
54. ιι) does not come within the period of Odes i-iii, but is recorded
in Epp. 1. ιι. 26, and alluded to in Od. 4. 14. 41.

ξ 7. Ducr', Getae, Syllae, Geloni-There is much vagueness in the
use of these names by Horace, as indeed there is confessedly in their
use by prose writers of much later date. The name ‘Scythae’ is the
most comprehensive, being used apparently for all the tribes north of
the Danube and Euxine. At times it is brought into close relation
with that of the Getae (as in od. 3. 24. ιι), who again are closely
connected by all writers with the Daci. At other times it is asso·
ciated with the Geloni and the Tanais (‘ Scythicus amnis,' Od. 3. 4.
36), and denotes tribes far enough to the East to interfere in Parthian
