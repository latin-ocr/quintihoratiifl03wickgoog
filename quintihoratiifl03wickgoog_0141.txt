104 HORATII CARMINUM

Ο D E XXXVI.

‘Tarum to the gods that have brought Numida sale home again, to the delight
os many friends, and ot' none more than his old schoolsellow Lamia. Τίιι day
rnust hare a white stone to mark it. We will revel, we will danne: Bassus shall
rival Damalis in his draughts ol wine today. Every eye will be on Damalis; but
Damalis will have no embraces sor any one but Numida!

Nothing is known ol Numida. Aer. and Porph. eall him ‘Pomponius Numida,’
the Comm. Cruq. ‘Plotius' The latter is more likely to be right. as Numida is
a known cognomen of the Plautia or Plotia gens. It is usually supposed that
he was retuming from the Cantabrian war, from which Augustus returned in ,
ιιι. 25 (Od. 3. ι4). Numida may os course conceivably have returned earlier.

For Lamia. see on Od. 1. 26.
For the subject os the Ode cp. r. 7 on the return ot' Pompeius.
