This is compend entirely of the scot called ⁴ Ionicus a minore ¹:—

υ υ —- —.

. The meu-e is described by Hephaestion, who takes ns his type m
Ode of Alcaeus, of which the first line, which he quotes, seems ns is it
my hnve been the original os Honee's Ode (see Introd. ιο Od ³* η).
Ῑῑ is not, ne says, ns it may easily be taken to be, an unbroken sncces-
sion of similar feet. but broken into periods os ten feet enth- Bentley
pointed out that Horace's Ode oonsists of sorty feet, ᾖε. four such
pexiods, and held thu the arrangement in lines, which rnzny editors
debite, was merely a necessity of the writer or printer, md not lo be
elevated into a law os the metre.

ἱ 6, Α few words may be added on what is called by some editors
‘Meineke's canon! He noticed that, with two exceptione, 111 the
Odes' os Horace containz number ol* lines which is a multiple of four.
Os these, 3- u has just been diseussed. It has been arranged by some
persons in sunzas of four lines (see I-kcurs. on it in Orelli’s edition);
but it might fairly be contended. either that the nature os the meere
consisting not of versesy but of feet, aempted it from the common
category, or thar, inasmuch as it consists of four periods os ten feet
each, it complice with the same conditions ω other Odet. The other
exception is Od. 4. 8, which contains thirty>sonr verses. 1: uo
happens that this Ode already lay under some suspicion, on aeonum
of the historica! difficulty of v. ¹⁷¹- On this sm Meineke lzid
down the general law thzt all the Odes consui-med ω the type or the
Alenic, Sapphic, and third, sounh, nnd fifth Aselepiad metten, and
were to be broken into four-line stantes. Od. 4. 8 was to be rectified
