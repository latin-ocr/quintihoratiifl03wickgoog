ODE XV.

Nmus beoalms Paris, as he flies with Helen, to loretel to him his own tate and
the destruction oi Troy.

‘Hac ode Bacchylidem imitatum nam ut ille Cassandram facit vaticinari sutura
belli Troiani ita hic Proteum,' Porph. (The last word is a slip arising t'rom a
reminiscence of the prophecies of Proteus in Hom. Od. 4.) The same statement
is repeated by a Scholiast on Stat. Theb. 7. 330. Ii, however, the fine verses
which Clement ol Alexandria quotes, without giving the name ol their author
(Strom. 5. 731 ὁ Δορικόι φησι), belonged, as is commonly believed, to this poem,
Horace's imitation cannot have extended beyond the mere srameworlr.

The lines of Bacchylides are :-

ὦ Τρῶιι Ἀρηΐφιλοι, Zeis ὑψιμέδων, δι ἅπαντα δέρκεται

οὐκ airaon θνατοΐι μεγάλων ἀχέον ἀλλ’ ἐν μέσῳ κεῖται κιχεῖν
πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποισι Δι’καν ὁσίαν, ἁγνάν,

nnana· ἀκόλουθον nal πινυτᾶι olarios·

ὀλβίαν veelle νιν εὑρόντιι σύνοικον.

Fr. ²9 (Bergk).

The imagery ol Horace’s Ode is really Homer’s rather than that ol the Greek
lyrists‚ cp. Od. 1. 6.

Α Scholiast calls the Ode an allegory of Antony and Cleopatra, and that ex·
planation oi it is adopted by several editors, laudium, Baxter, and Sanadon. Ritter
draws the parattd out in detail. Paris, hidden by Venus in Helen's chamber, is
Antony taking refuge in Cleopatra’s ship at Actium, etc. The whole theory is
very improbable. Mitsch. remarks that the first suggestion ol it is probably due
to the position oi the Ode. The key which had unlocked the last was applied to
this. Compare the relation of the next two Odes to one another.

The Ode is imitated by Statius, Achill. 1. ιο soll.
