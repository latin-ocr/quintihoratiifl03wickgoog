ODE XXV.

In this Ode. ns in a. 19. Horace has tried to catch the inspiration os a Greek
dithyramb. ln that one he professes to recall the effects which the sight ol
Bacchus had upon him: in the present one he is actually under the influence ol
the afflatus. ‘He is hurried away, whither he knows not: his eyes are opened on
strange cavems and river-bunks and woods. His tongue will be loosed in a
moment to sing no humhle theme, and in no common strain, the glories of Caesar:
he follows the god. lor he must. and it is delightlul, but it is learlul too)

The glory oi Caesar is only mentioned ss the subject ol the coming burst os
song; but the place of honour given to it is in effect the celebration which is
promised. Sce1.6,1ntrod.
