‘Meu have dillerent ideas ol glory and happiness-success in the Olympio gamer.
civic honours, weulth. The sarmer will not tum trader lor any prospect oi riches,
nor the trader give up the sea sor any danger. One likes a lise ol ease; another
the excitemeuts ol war or spurt. My taste is lyric poetry, aud my glory that you
should raulr me with the lyric poets ol Greece!

The Ode is clearly written as an introduction. (Cp. the tone ol Od. 3. 30, when
the work is done.) Itis dedicated to Maecenas-as is the tirst of the Epodes. the
first ol the Satires. the first of B. i. ol the Epistles. See Introd. to Books i-iii. 5 11. 2.

Compare also Od. 4. 3, which recells the main thoughts ot this Ode, though its
confident tone und the absence os a patron's name point the change which had by
that time come upon the poet's circumstances. There is no need in either Ode to
trace the ‘incongruous' mention of the Olympic gemes as among the natural
objects os ambition to the remembrance oi any special Greek original, such as
Piud. Fr. 201:-

humatur plu τιν’ «ceptrum lum
τίμια acl artocem rode δ’ ἔν πολυχρύσου θαλάμοιο βιοτά, e. nrt.

The purpose is to give the feeling ol a wide survey os human lise. aud Horace does
not draw c strong line between the Greek lile which survived in literature and the
actual Roman lite ol his own day. The apology for poetry. as one among the
various testes os mankind,is as old at least as Solon (2. 43-52), and Horace would
remember the eud os Virg. G. ι, esp. vv. 503 soll. For the sume thoughts iu a less
poetical form. cp. Sat. 2. 1. ²4 soll. ‘Quot capitum vivunt totidem studiorum Millia:
me pedibus delectat claudere verba, etc.’
