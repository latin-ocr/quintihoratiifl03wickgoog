INTRODUCTION TO BOOK lV.

-——-———

Tanna is no reason to doubt the account given by Suetonius
of the origin of this Book. The occasion and general date of
it are fixed clearly on its own evidence. With the exception of
Ode 6, which is manifestly written at the same time as the Carmen
Seculare, i. e. in a. c. 17, all the Odes that can be dated refer imme·
diately to two events, viz. (ι) the return of Augustus to Rome in
a. c. 13, alter three years' absence in Gaul, whither he had gone in the
year 16, on the news of the defeat of Lollius by the Sygambri ;
(a) the-double campaign of Drusus and Tiberius in Raetia and
Vindelicia, which occupied the year 15.

The general tone os the Book, as well as its particular references
suit the period thus assigned to it. Its opening bears witness to the
interval which separatos it from Horace's last essays in lyric verse.

changes in the poet’s fortunes, as well asin the political world. The
contrast of 4.5 or 15 with r. ra or ³: 24, is hardly more striking
than that of 4. 3 with 1. r. The sons ol Livia have taken the
place ol Marcellus; the military triumphs, and the moral and social
reiorms which in the earlier Books were prophecy‚ are now, if we
may believe Horace, history; the Cantabrian, ‘non ante domabilis,'
is no longer a cause of disquiet ; the Parthians have restored the
standards ol Charrae‚ and Phraates and bis quarrels are sorgotten 3
the vague alarms about the Dacian, or projects os conquest in Britain,
bave given place to real dangers met on the Rhine‚ and substantia]
victories won in the Eastern Alps. The position of one name in the
Book marks more clearly still the contrast between the two epochs,
both in respect ol the outer world andos Horace's own life. Mae·
cenas, whom even in nc. 19 he addressed as ‘prima dicte mihi
summa dicende camena’ is mentioned but once in this Book. His
birthday is the occasion of Ode 11, and he is spoken of in terms
