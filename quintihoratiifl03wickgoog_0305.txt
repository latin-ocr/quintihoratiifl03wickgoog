may sing of Augustus returning in triumph with the Sygambri at his
chariot wheels, and of the people’s joy. It may be, in the rapture
of that happy day, even he too may find a voice and sing his best, and
shout with the shouting people‚ and make his humble offerings! And
yet—the tone changes in Ode 3—he remembers that ‘he is a poet,
set apert from his birth by the Muse from common ambitibus and
glories, recognised as such hy the voice of Rome ; and so, though all
the glory is the Muse’s, not his own, he will venture, and somewhat
loudly sweep the string’ ,

3. The middle of the Book is occupied with the expausion of the
same theme as that of Ode 3, the only theme besides the triumphs
and blessings of the empire which seems to wake him to any of his
old lyric fire, the consciousness of his own poetic power, and the
immortality which he can confer on others as he has secured it for
himself¹. Odes 6, 8, 9, like Ode 3, while they express Horaee’s
inmost feelings, lead also directly to the main purpose of the Book.
In his own words he gives Augustus the panegyrie ior which he had
asked, and ‘pretium dicit muneri! They are divided by Ode 7,
which enforces the lesson that no other immortality must be looked .
f0r; high blood, eloquence, piety, are alike powerless to save from
the ending of all mortality—a handful of dust and ashadow. They
are followed by the Ode to Ligurinus, a forced tribute to the professions
of Ode 1, and with reference to it. Then he finds a place not too
conspicuous for his private friendship for Maecenas. Two more
Odes in his old character as a poet of wine and of love, the second
manifestly a companion and sequel to an Ode of Book iii, complete
what he thinks necessary to give the reliel of variety, aud he returns
to Tiberius' victory and, what he values more, the domestic peace of

“ Augustus’ reign.
