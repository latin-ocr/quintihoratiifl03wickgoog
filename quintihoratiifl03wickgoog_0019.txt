xiv INTRODUCTION.

we have numerous quotations, chiefly in the grammatica! authors
os the first five centuries. These are rarely oi' any very high value;
partly because quomtions seem osten to be made srom memory, partly
because the quotation is most commonly nude sor some metrical
or gramutatical reason which is not affected by the special word
or form in respectos which the doubt exists, and therefore the testi·
mony to the reading is not in truth older than the MSS. (not usually
very ancient) of the gramniatical author himself.

So far, then, as extemal testimony goes, it is clear that when a dis-
puted reading occurs, the evidence to which we ean appeal to determine
it contains in every department some elements os uncertainty, aud is not
likely to be rated nt the same relative value by all critics. Can the MSS*
be made, hy any process ot compar-ison, to testisy, through common
readings, to sources of evidence older than themselves, older even than
the Scholia? Has the value os any special MS. been unduly esti·
mated? Is a particular Scholiurn genuine, or is it an interpolation
to suit a late MS. reading? There will remain these and other
previous questions upon which perfect agreement cannot always be

’ obtained ; and. in default of such agreement, an editor or a render

who approaches questions ot text on this side, consessedly with only
second-hand knowledge, can hardly form his jndgments too modestly.
1t must not be supposed, however, that the criticism os Horace's text,
any more than the cn'ticism of other classical texts, turns by any
means entirely upon the testimony of MSS. or Scholia. However
iar these carry us back, they leave us, ou the one hand, with the
certainty that varieties of reading existed, and that emendation on
grammatica! or other grounds had been tt work, still earlier 5 and,
on the other hand, they leave, is not very many blots which modern
criticism has unanimonsly reeognised and corrected, yet enough of
these¹ to make us feel that when the question lies between an ι’ or an
e, an e or an a, one or other expansior-i os an ambiguous abbreviation,
and the like, MS> testimony cannot be held to settle it absolutely,
without any appeal to grammar or sense. We must add that in the
majority of really doubtful readings no theory with respect to the
