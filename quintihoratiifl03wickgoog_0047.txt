ιο INTRODUCTION TO THE ODES.

simplicity and light-heartedness, stands at the end oi a long Book as
well as immediately aster the high-pitched Ode ou Cleopatra.

instances where we may see certainly the love of variety, very
possibly an undertone ο1 irony, are the position ο1 ‘Quum tu Lydia
Telephi,' aiter r. 12, aud that 31 ‘ Quid fles, Asteriel' alter the stately
Odes that begin Book iii. The mere desire to change the hey is well
exemplified in r. 34, 35 33(1 3. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, ²9·

4. 11 r. 38 has a fitness at the end ο1 3 Book, we may note a
similar fitness t'or their place in 3. 3ο and 3. r. The adaptation
indeed ο1 these two Odes to their position was donbtless what sug·
gested the now abandoned theory ol 3 separate publication os Books
i, ii, aud Book iii. That theory can really derive no support srom
them, for it would necessitate, as we have seen, an entire rearrange·
ment ο1 the Odes in 3 chronological order, in the course ο1 which all
evidence would disappear oi the position oi these two Odes as well as
os all the others.

5. The hand oi a conscious arranger must surelybe seen in the iact
that Odes r-9 ο1 Book i contain, with three exceptions, one of
which is made good in the 11th Ode, representatives ο1 311 the metres
employed in the Three Books We may compare with this the
obviously metrical disposition os the Epodes 1-10‚ 11-16, 17, and the

regular altemation ο1 Alcaics and Sapphics through more than half
ο1 Book ii ο1 the Odes.

6. Where definite contrasts are not required, we may see from time
to time in the selection the working of the opposite principle ο1
association, sometimes in a general similarity ο1 subject as between
a. 13, 143 3. 9-12: sometimes in some accidental phrase or thought
which seems to recall another poem to the arranger, and guide
his hand to it, as in r. 17, where Cyrus' tipsy brawls seem to
suggest the Ode which follows on the moderate use ο1 wine; r. 34,
where the mention ο1 Fortune, even though in a different sense or
point ol view, is a link to the following Ode to Fortuna Antias3 3. 17,
where the invitation to keep holiday, with which the Ode ends, sug·
gests the special holiday picture os the Faunalia in 3. 18.
