O DE XIII.

‘Blunusm Sabinensis agri regio est iu qua Horatii ager tuit: Aer. The Ode
itselr certainly suggests such a locality. The poet seems to be at home at the
spring. 'lhe surrounding objects are too familiar to obtrude themselves on the
picture. The spring, now called ‘Fontana degli Oratini,' ou the hill-side between
the two suggested sites sor Horace's lanu, answers weII enough to the description.
It gushes out suddenly at the bottom of a small iace os rock, crowned now, not by
ilex. but by a figtree, and its rush oi cold water, the crystal cIearness oi the basin
thch it forms, and then the lise with which it starts to bound aud prattle down
the steep slope to the valley are quite enough to wake apoet's enthusiasm. On
the other hand, it has been shown that as late as the rath century there was a
church standing on a site which can be Identified about six miles south oi Venusia,
which is named in ecclesiastical documents oi the time as ‘Eccl SS. ΜΜ. Gervasi
et Protesi in Bandusino Fonte apud Venusiam! Ii this evidence he held conclusive
we must either suppose that Horace writes from an affectionate memory oi the
Bandusian spring, such as he elsewhere shows oi Mount Vultur, the nestling village
os Acherontis, and other spots near the home oi his boyhood; or, ii ‘cras dona·
beris’ seems too definite ior a mere address oi lancy, we must conclude that at
some period in his lise he revisited Venusia. The fact, however, that he does not
himself indicate the locality oi the ‘Fons Bandusiae ¹ may have caused topogmphers
to make various guesses in early times as wellas late, and the Venusian claimant
oi the name need not he the genuine one. Verses 2-8 are probably interpreted oi
the Fontanalia, a festival on Oct. ιι, named by Varro, Ling. Lat. 5, ‘in fontes
coronas iaciunt et puteos coronant'
