Et praeceps Anio ac Tiburni lucus et uda
Mobilibus pomaria rivis.
Albus ut obscuro deterget nubila caelo
Saepe Notus neque parturit imbres ⁴
Perpetuo, sic tu sapiens finire memento
Tristitiam vitaeque labores
Molli, Plance, mero, seu te fulgentia signis
Castra tenent seu densa tenebit
Tiburis umbra tui. Teucer Salamina patremque
Cum sugeret, tamen uda Lyaeo
Tempora populea sertur vinxisse corona,
Sic tristes aflatus amicos:
Quo nos cunque leret melior fortuna parente, ας

13. Tiburni, acc. to Virg. Aen. 7.
672, Tiburnus (Virg. utils him ‘Tibur-
tus ⁹), Catillus (⁴ carnus: Hor. Od. 1.
18. a). and Coras were three Argiue
brothers, founders oi Tibur. '

points ol the romantio alifis on the
western hill side?

15. albus, predicative. The south
wind is sometimes λευκόνοτοε, not al-
ways ‘niger Auster! The lesson is that
the very same wind which brings the
clouds will presently clear them. ‘Al-
bus’ as ‘albus Iapyx: Od. 3. ²7· ¹93
‘candidi Favonii} 3. 7. 1.

16. mmutlt, aee on Od. 4. 5. 26.

17. uolens, ‘be wise and remem-
ber.' etc, od. 1. 11. 6 ‘sapias vina

19. molli, ‘mellow,’ as ‘lene' Oc. 3.
²9· a. It breslss the tiow oi the sen·
tence needlessly to take ‘molli' with
Ritter, as an imperative.

20. tenent..tensbit, ‘as now: ‘as
hy and bye,’ stress is clearly laid on the
tenses, sc that apparently Plancus was

now, or might be supposed tc be, cam·
pmfinlhl‘l. This story oi Teucer is not
found elsewhere. beyond the fact of his
being ill-received by his father Telamon
because he returned without Ajax, and
ot' his founding Salamis in Cyprus.
Cicero may possibly be referring to a
common source in Tusc. 5. 37 ‘ad om·
nem rationem Teucri vox accommodari
potest: Patria est ubicunque est bene!

suppose, see on v. 32.

3. 9. Orelli quotes Xenophon, hnab. 6.
2. 9, who speaks ol sacrificing τῷ ἠγ(-

27. duce et auspice, ‘underTeucer's
conduct and Teuoer's star,’ a curicus
technicality oi Roman military lise lo
put into Teucer's mouth. 'Ductu et
auspicio.‘ Liv. 6. ης 'domuit partim
ductu partim auspiciis suis Cantabriam,'
etc.. Suet. Oct. 21. The two did not
necessarily belong to the same person.
The auspices were taken in the name
ol the imperator. and the ‘felicitas' was
his, see Ona 14· 33 soll. Horace has
not exactly reproduced the technical
phrase. lor we find ‘auspiciis Camilli,
Augusti,' etc. not ‘auspice Camillo?
