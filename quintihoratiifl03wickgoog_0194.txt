LIB. II. OD. 18.

Aedemque votivam memento:
Nos humilem feriemus agnam.

was the name ol a ‘collegium merca· who could buy everythingso asto malre

of traffic, Cic. ad Quint. Fr. a. ς. Liv. the Greek Hermes) to hImsels, as under

O D E XVIII.

‘l aava no ivory couches nor giIded ceiling nor rare marbles nor palace nor >
crowd of retainers. Yet I have honour and wit and the respect os those richer
than mysels, and I am eontented. You lay house to house as is you were to live sor
ever. ‘Ibe land is not large enough, you must buiId in the sea. Nay,you must
pluck up your neighbour‘s Iandmarlr and drive out your own client to misery.
Yet more surely than any house you are building the grave awaits you. ‘ Think os
that limit—lhe grave, where you and your poor neighbours, oppressor and op
pressed, are oh an equality.'

Horace opposes two pictores: one, os himself, contented and happy with his sarm

and his poetry; the other, of some rich man so lull os plans sor huilding and in· ,

creasing his property asto sorget death and to commit wrong and robbery. Ode
15 complained of the great growth ol the villas ol the wealthy on the ground ol'
the waste os ground which was wanted for agriculture. This Ode touches ou
another evil incidental to this passion. the unjust and cruel ejection ol small owners
from their ancestral properties. It is this which gives the special colour to the
usual satire on the solly os leaving death ont ol our calculations. Death is not
only more certain than all our plans-he is the great equalizer and redresser ol

wrongs.

with the picture os the grasping proprietor compare Sallust's expressions where
he is tracing thet alienation of classes which led to the civil wara, Jug. 41 ‘populus
militia atque inopia urgebatur; praedas bellicas imperatores cum paucis diripie-
bant; interea parentes aut parvi liberi militum utquisque potentiori confinis erat .
sedibus pellebantur!

The early part os the Ode is not unlike in expression a fragment (ιὸ) oi
Bacchylides :-

od βοῶν τάριστι σώματ’, οὔτε χρυσόι, οὔτε πορφύρεοι τόητιι, ἀλλὰ duple εὖμινὴι
Μοῦσά τι γλυκεῖα aar Βοιωτίοισιν ἔτ σκύφοισιν οἶνοι ridde.
