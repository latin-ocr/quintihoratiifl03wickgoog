ΟΝ THE UNKNOWN NAMES IN THE ODES.

Ir is hardly necessary to read Esne's summary of the many and
mutually destructive theories that have been proposed in order to
pereeive the sutility of attempting to construet out ol the Pyrrhas,
Lalages, Lydios ol the Odes a history of Horaee's loves and dis·
appointments. Whatever foundation any Ode may have had in the
feelings or laets ol the moment it is impossible now to distinguish
shadow lrom substance; and there is much to indicate that Horace
did not wish it to be otherwise. Whatever be their origin, he treats
bis love Odes as artistic studies. He arranges them not, we ean feel
sure, in any chronological order as remembrances ol his own lile,
but where they will be most usesul to relieve more serious poems
or to stand side by side as companion pictures. We may see as
much as this from the nature os the names whieh he employa.
A certain number owe their seleetion obviously to their etymologieal
meaning, such as Pyrrha in 1. 5, Chloe· in r. 23, Lyce in 3. ιο, Phi·
dyle in 3. 2 3 (cp. Sybaris in 1. 8 ; the list may possibly be extended
by tho names of Lalage in 1. aa, Leuconoe in r. 11, and ol Telephus
r.13,etc. Horace is lond of playing on the meaning of names,
‘Glycerae immitis,' 1. 33. a, ‘Bibuli consulis amphoram,' 3. 28, 8,
‘Dulci Lyaeo solvere,' Epod. 9. 38). Some more are suspiciously
well adapted to the metre oi the special poem ς Leuconoe has this
reason at any rate lor her existence, so has ‘Asterie' in 3. 7, and
‘Neobule' (cp. the name oi her lover, ‘Liparaeus Hebrus ') in the
Ionie a minore metre os 3. ra. With one or two exceptions the
unknown male names in the Odes (the names ol Horaee's rivals,
as in r. r 3, ou any theory os a real Lydia) are Greek names, Tele·
phus, Gyges, Calais; mythological names; sometimes the names os
Greek rivers, Hebrus 3. ra, Enipeus 3. 7. We may add perhaps
that where the designation is most full and precise we seem to see
most definitely the purpose os giving momentary substance to an
acknowledgedshadow; see on ‘Thurini Calais filivs Ornyti' 3.9. 14, ani
ep. Introd. to 2. 4. In a few cases we seem to see the appropriation
