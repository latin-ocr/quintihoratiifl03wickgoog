HORATII CARMINUM

Delenit usus nec Falerna
Vitis Achaemeniumque costum,
Cur invidendis postibus et novo
Sublime ritu moliar atrium?
Cur valle permutem Sabina
Divitias operosiores?

which makes·sidereclarior'agree with ment: so that the ideas os the two
‘usus’ rather than with ‘purpurarum’ lines will be exactly parallel to Virg.
(cp. 3. 21. 19 ‘iratos regum apices‚' and G. a. 461-463 ‘Si non ingentem foribus
Epod. 10. 12 and 14), is the same as domus alta su rbis Mune salutantum
