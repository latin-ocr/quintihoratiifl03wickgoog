ODE V.

‘Jova’r thunder proves him the souereign ot the sky. Augustus shall prove
himself a god upon earth by adding to the empire Britain and the batelul
Parthians-O shame to think oi the disgrace not yet wiped away t-Roman
soldiers living as captives. lorgetsul oi name aad country. and country's gods.
This was the danger that Regulus soresaw ii prisonem were allowed to hope sor
ransom·u Iaet them die,” be said, “and pity them not. 1 have seen with my
own eyes the sight ot' shame: Roman staudards nailed up in Punic temples with
armour that was taken not from the dead but from the living :-Roman citizens
with their hands bound behind their backs-Carthage peacesul aud busy :-tha
work ot' our war undone. Will you buy those soldiers back again? It will be a
waste oi money. The deer caught in the net does not fight again ir you loose it.
nor does the man who has onoe teared death make a soldier again. lie does not
know what war means.'' lie put aside his wife and children, and hung his head
as one disgraced, till the senate listened to his advice; then he went back to tor·
ture and death with as light a heart as ir' he were going tor a holiday.'

Another phase os Augustus' mle. lie is to retrieve the deeplyrelt disgraee of
Charrae, and to restore the healthy military spirit ot ancient Rome. We haue in
the story ot Regulus at once a measure os the disgrace to be retrieved.-‘ lt is the
very disgrace which he seared and ioretold and went back to the torture in order
to prevent‚’—anda picture oi the true Roman spirit which is to be raawakened.

'ibe whole sentiment ol the speech may be compared with Liv. aa. 59-61·

The story ot' Regulus' mission to Rome is not found in Polybius, a sact which
has been held to throw doubt on its truth. It is summarized in the Epitome of
Liv.18. With Cicero itisacommonplace. It is told at lengthin the De Off. 3.
27. a passage of which Horace recalls several turus of thought and expression.
