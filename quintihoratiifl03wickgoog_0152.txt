LIB. ll. OD. 2.

ODE '11.

‘Wranrn has no value save to use well: used as Proculeius used it, it wins
immortalfame. To tame the spirit of avarice is more than to own the world.
Avariee is like the thirst of dropsy, which grows by indulgence. Virtue calls him
alone happy, him alone the true king, who has subdued the love of money.'

That the Ode is addressed to Salustius is enough to show that there could he
no danger of the world's applying its doctrine to him.

The little we know of him is chiefly derived from Tacitus, Anu. 3. 30, where
his death in nn. ao is recorded: 'Crispum equestri looo, C. Salustius rerum
Romanarum florentissimus auctor, sororis nepotem, in nomen adscivit. Atque ille
quanquam prompto ad capessendos honores aditu, Maecenatem aemulatus, sine
dignitate senatoria multos triumphalium consulariumque potentia anteiit, diversus a
veterum instituto per cultum et munditias copiaque et affluentia luxu propior.
Suberat tamen vigor anhni negotiis par, eo acrior quo somnum et inertiam magis

him sorne years before (Sat. 1. a. 48 foll), but he has now made his acquaintance in
the Court circle. Pliny (N. H. 34. 2) mentions that the Sallust family possessed
copper mines in the Tarentaise (Ceutronum tractu '), and it has been suggested
that this gave a special point to the first stanza, ‘As you know from your expe·
rience of ore!
