174 HORATII CARMINUM

Alexandriam (a town in the Troad) vel Ilium translatis simul opibus imperii
exhaustaque Italia delectibus et procuratione urbium amicis permissa’ It has
been suggested that this idea imputod to Caesar, and eventually carried out by
Constantine, may have been in men's'minds, and that Horace, possibly nt the
inspiration oi Augustus. sets himself to discourage it. His protest, however, isan
empty one. The mythological argument could not be serious, and no other is
brought sorward. Dillenburger, with more lilrelihood, imagines that the poet's
purpose is to condemn Trojan manners, Asiatic pertidy and luxury, and that the
rebuilding ol Troyis an allegory, suggested perhaps hythe rumour before men·
tioned oi Julius Caesar's design. Cp. Carm. Sec. 37 soll.. etc.

The Ode is more in Pindar’s style than any that precedes it. The mythological
part oi it occupies a larges space, is handled with more ireedom, and is leit more
completely to tell its own tale. Cp. 3. 11 and 3. 27.

Several MSS. including V and A (B omits Odes 2-6), wrote this Ode continu· .
ously with the Second; and Porphyrion, noticing the question, decides that they
‘manifeste cohaerent) The authority ot the MSS. on the point (see Introd. to 1.
7) isweakened by the lact that the same ones join a. ι 5 and 16, evidently wrongly.
Ode 2 has no unity which would be injured by a closer connection with 3, and the
topic os its last two snnzas is not alien to the praise oi justice aud constancy.
Porphyrion is inclined to press too hard the connection between the six Odes3 see
on v. l. oi Ode ᾳ
