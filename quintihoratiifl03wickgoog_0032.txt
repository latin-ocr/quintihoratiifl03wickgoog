venia impetrata, scriptum quaestorium comparavit' This means
the place 01 2 ‘scriba' or cleri, in the quaestor's office, and
Horace’s appointment to it is connected by some with his
father's old employment as ‘coactor exactionum']

nc. 38 (i). Introduction to Maecenas—Sat. 1. 6. 54 1011. The date 01
this is lixed by a comparison os Sat. 2. 6. 40 ‘Septimus octavo
propior iam fugerit annus, Ex quo Maecenas me coepit habere
suorum In numero,' with the references in vv. 38, 53, 55, which
seem to fix the composition 01 that Satire to the end 01 nc. 31.
