ODE XII.

Tms Ode seems to be rightly taken by Orelli and Dill‘. as a soliloqny put into
the mouth ot N eobule. ‘She is one ol the nnhappy maidens who can neither give
free play to their love nor lorget it over the wine cup without the dread osan
uncle's heroe tongue. She cannot attend to her womanly work lor the thought ot
Hebrus' beauty.-chrus, as he comes fresh from his swim in the Tiber after bis ⁸
morning’s exercise, lor he is the best ol ridere. boxers, mnners, huntsmen.'

The older theory made it all an address of the poet to Neobule. But in his
mouth the contrast oi the lot ol men and women is not very gracelul, nor the con·
nection between vv. 1=3 and the remainder ol the Ode very clear, nor the recital ol
Hebrus' accomplishments very appropriate. Ritter‚ allowing the whole to be put
into Neobnle's mouth, makes vv.4-1a the ‘patruae verbera linguae‘ which she
imagines to herself. The uncle, however, would harldy spend the greater part of
his scolding in praising her lover,

Gesner follows Acron in taking the whole as ironioal, ‘Sotadico versu? Tne
idea seems to have arisen from an attempt to interpret the names, ‘Hebrus'
(cp. 1. 25. ιο) as ‘Vetuhts quidam et odiosus'; “Liparaeus' as ‘bleareyed,'
¹ vatem-like! There are no other indications of such a meaning in the Ode.

The verse which Hephaestion quotes, to illustrate the lonic metre. srom the
beginning ol a poem os Alcaeus. tue erim tae παισᾶν mordear πιδέχιισιν, reads
as is Alcaens' Ode had been in some way the original of this one, and it savonrs
also the view that Neobnle is speaking in this Ode os herself.
