ODE XIV.

‘How can senate and people worthily honour thy virtues, Augustus, and trans·
mit their memory to all timei The triumphs oi the Nero brothers, oi Drusus over
the Vindelici, the Genauni and Breuni, oi Tiberius over the Raeti, are all owing to
thy auspices. How terrible was Tiberius in the pursuit; as the south wind on the
waters, or as the river Aufidus when it pours in a torrent from the hilis down on
the plain. Thine were the plan and provision oi the campaign, thine its divinely-
ordered success. lor the victory came on a day already noteworthy ior thy happy
fortune-just fifteen years after the capture oi Alexandria Thy reign bas been
a series oi triumphs, and now all the world is at thy leet!

For some account oi 'liberius' campaign in ac. 15 see introd. to the Book.
