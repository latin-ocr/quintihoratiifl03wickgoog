LIB. III. OD. 8.

ODE VIII.

Tne Ode is written sorau expected or imagined risit os Maecenas. on the first
anniversary os the poet's narrow escape from the falling tree (a. 13, a. 17. 27, 3. 4.
η). The festival os March 1 was the Matronalia. Maecenas is supposed on his
entry to wonder what can be the reason that a bachelor's home shows preparation
sor sacrifice ou such a day. The answer is, that the poet is‘paying a vow to Bac·
chus. which he had made at the tirne os his miraculous preservation. ‘The best
wine is to be brought out,' and so the Ode pasces into an invitation to Maecenas
to enter into the spirit os the time—to surget the troubles os State. ‘All is going
well; the Dacians are checked, the Parthians quarrelling among themselves, even
the Cantabrian subdued at last. and the Scythians unstringing their bows; Mae·
cenas may enjoy a little privacy and immunity Irom care.'
