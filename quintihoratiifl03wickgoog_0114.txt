LIB. Ι. OD. 26.

ODE XXVI.

‘Trur Muse's friend, 1 can cast sorrow and fears to the winds. The politica of
Parthia that trouble all the world are nothing to me. Help me. sweet Mose. to
weare a chaplet of freshest lyric verse for my dear friend Lamia!

It is difficolt to see the point of connection between the first and last parts of the
Ode. unless. indeed, as has been suggested. Horace is holding up his own cheerfulness
and its source to Lamia’s imitation. see Introd. to od. 3. 17. If Epp. 1. 14. 6 refer
to the same person as the two odes. the trait there given. ‘rapto de fratre dolentis
Insolabiliter: may confirm the idea that he was a person on whom sorrow sat
heavily. '

Aelius Lamia, the school friend of Numida (Od. r. 36. 7) and the ‘vetusto no·
bilis ab lamo' of 3, 17· r, is generally identified with L. Aelius Lamia who was
Praefectus urbi in ao. 3²· and died aa. 33. Tac Anu. 6. ²7 ‘genus illi decorum.
vivida senectus.¹ Ifthis Ode therefore is to be dated before ac. 23, he nrust have
been quite a young man when it was written. itiner, feeling this to be a difficulty,
suggests that the ‘Lamia of the Odes is an elder brother of Lucius. The name of
aQ, Aelius lamia. ‘triumvir monetalis: has been found on a coin of this date.
He thinks that it is his death that Lucius isrepresented as lamenting in Epp. r.
14 6.

On the date of the Ode aad the allusion of vv. 3-5 see Introd. to Odes iiii, 58.

With vv. r-6 ep. Virg. G. 2. 490-497. The friendship of the Muses gives to
Horace the freedom which Virgil attributes to philosophy and a country life.
