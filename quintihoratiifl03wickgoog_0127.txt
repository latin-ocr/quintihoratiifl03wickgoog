Trur Ode professes to be written (ac. 28) on the day on which Augustus
dedicated the temple οἱ Apollo on the Palatino, to which was attached the famous
Library, see Epp. 1. 3. 17, π. t. 217, a. r. 93, Suet. Aug. 29, Dio C. 53. 1. Pro-
pertius gives an account oi the inauguration of the temple, at which he had
himself been present, 3. ²3 ‘Quaeris cur veniam tibi tardior? Aurea Phaebo
Porticus a magno Caesare aperta luit,' etc.

‘What special boon shall his poet aslr oi Apollo todayl Not wealth in corn-
lands or cattle, not gold and ivory, not vineyards in Campania. He envies neither
those who grow the rich wines nor the trader who at the eost os so much rislr
buys and drinks them. Content with humble iare, all he aska is the power to
enjoy health, a sound mind now, and an old age not wanting either in honour or
in the pleasure oi poetry!
