LIB. IV. OD. r.

Illic plurima naribus

Duces thura, lyraeque et Berecyntiae
Delectabere tibiae

Mixtis carminibus non sine fistula3
Illic bis pueri die ⁴

Numen cum teneris virginibus tuum
Laudantes pede candido

In morem Salium ter quatient humum.
Me nec semina nec puer

Iam nec spes animi credula mutui,
Nec certare iuvat mero,

Nec vincire novis tempora floribus.
Sed cur heu, Ligurine, cur

Manat rara meas lacrima per genas?
Cur facunda parum decoro

Inter verba cadit lingua silentio?
Nocturnis ego somniis

Iam captum teneo, iam volucrem sequor
Te per gramina Martii

Campi, te per aquaS, dure, volubiles. 40
