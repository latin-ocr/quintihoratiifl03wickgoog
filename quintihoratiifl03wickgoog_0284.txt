ODE XXV.

In this Ode, as in a. 19, Horace has tried to catch the inspiration ot' a Greek
dithyramb. In that one he professes to recall the effects which the sight os
Bacchus had upon him: in the present one he is actually under the influence oi
the afflatus. ‘He is hurried away, whither he knows not: his eyes are opened on
strange caverns and river-banks aud woods. His tongue will be loosed in a
moment to sing no humble theme, and in no common strain, the glories os Caesar:
he follows the god, sor he must, and it is delightlul, but it is icariul roo!

The glory oi Caesar is only mentioned us the subject oi the coming burst os
song3 but the place of honour given to ir is in effect the celebration which is
promised. See 1. 6, Introd.
