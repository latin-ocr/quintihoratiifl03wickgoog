HOMTH CARMINL'M

Audis quo strepitu ianua, quo nemus 5

Inter pulchra satum tecta remugiat

Ventis, et positas ut glaciet nives
Puro numine luppiter?

Ingratum Veneri pone superbiam,

Ne currente retro suuis eat rota.

Nou te Penelopen difficilem procis
Tyrrhenus genuit parens

Ο quamvis neque te munera nec preces

N ec tinctus viola pallor amantium

Nec vir Pieria pellice saucius .
Curvat, supplicibus tuis

Parcas, nec rigida mollior aesculo

Nec Mauris animum mitior anguibus.
