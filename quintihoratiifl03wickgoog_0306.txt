260 INTRODUCTION TO THE ODES.

which joins the Rhine opposite Bonn. Lollius met them and suffered
a deleat, which, though Suetonius makes less oi it (ι maioris infamiae
quam detrimenti: Aug. a 3) is ranked by Tacitus with that of Varus
(Ann. 1. ro). At any rate it was sufficient to make Augustus set out
in person hom Rome. Before, however, he reached the frontier, the
Sygambri, finding that Lollius was rallying his forces, and that rein·
lorcements were on their way from Rome, made a hasty peace, and
retired again beyond the Rhine. See Dio 54. ao. Augustus remained
in Gaul during the whole oi the two following years, and did not
return to Rome till the July of ac. 13·

a. In the meantime, in the year 15, an important and permanent
conquest had been effected by Tiberius and Drusus, the sons ol
Livia, by her former husband Ti Claudius Nero. Merivale recounts
(vol. iv, ch. 34, p. 142) the operations by which secure possession was
gained by Rome in Augustus' reign oi the western passes oi the Alps,
the Comiche Road‚ the passes that lead horn France to Turin, and
the St Bernard passes into the Val d’ Aosta. The work of Tiberius
and Drusus was directed to the similar objectos obtaining military
ἱ command oi the more eastern passes into the valeys oi the Rhine
and the Inn, which were still unsale ior the armies oi Rome or her
allies, and from which the mountain-tribes even issued from time
to time to plunder Italian soil. Drusus forced what is now known
as the Brenner pass, meeting and overthrowing the Rhaetians in
the vallcy near Tridentum, now Trent. In the meantime, or as
soon as Drusus' success was assured, Tiberius was detached from
Augustus' army in Gaul, with thc purpose oi taking the enemy in the
rear. He ascended the Rhine vallcy to the Lake ol Constance,
where he launched a flotilla oi boats‚ and entering at once several
ol the valleys which open on the lake, ‘penetrated the gorges oi the
Upper Rhine and lnn in every direction, so that at the conclusion
oi a brilliant and rapid campaign, the two brothers had effected the
complete subjugation oi the country oi the Grisons and the Tyrol!
‘The free tribes ol the Eastem Alps appear then for the first time in
history, only to disappear again ior a thousand years! Merivale,
