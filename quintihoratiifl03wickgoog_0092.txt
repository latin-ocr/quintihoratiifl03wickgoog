ODE XVI.

‘Fen daughter 01 a mother sair, though not so sair as you, born and sorget my
scurrilous iamhios, Pession is as resistless astho efflatus 01 Cybele, or Apollo,
epracchus. We are all liable to it, we all have our share 01 the lion’s heart.

Ip accordance with this the Odeis headed' ιιι the MSS Band A ad Tyn-

'emeat palinodiams r..e cantando revocat quae scripserat iratus' 111 amicam
casdim: Comm. Ctu'q. And so some MSS head it ‘Palinodia Gratidiae?

, Others unite the two views. and identiiy· Tyndaris' with‘ Gratidia' or Canidia';
‘Palinodia Gratidiae vel Tyndaridis!

For the first view, which identifies the unknown object oi this palinode with the
Tynderis 01 the following Ode, there seems to be no exteroal argument. There
was the temptation to connect the two Odes, to make the invitation 01 that the
compriment 01 the reconciliatioo m this; and the connection 01 the name 01 Helen
on the' one side with the name 01 Tyndaris. and on the other with the original
‘palinode’ would easily suggest to ingenious Scholiasts the desired link.

With respect to the second view the case is not so clear. 11 the ‘criminosi
iambi' here recanted are to be looked for among Horaoe’s extant poems, they can
hardly be, other than his attacks οιι Canidia in Epodes 5 and 17· To our ideas it
is a slight recantation 101 such a libel, so much so that it might seem to iorce us to
give both to the Epodes and to Sat. 1. 8 less reality than we should naturally give.
There is 110 bitterness in this Ode, nothing which would justiiy us in holding (sor
this is one suggestion) that it is acontinuation 01 the libel. the ‘tu pudica. tu proba'
which he offered 10 sing, ‘mendaci lyra,' ‘ tuning his harp to 1115011001,Ι in Epod.
17. 39.; but yet the tone 01 the palinode is barely serious. There is a mock heroic
air in the ‘urbes altae: ‘Thyestes' ‘Prometheus’ (comp. Od. 2. 4, 4. 11. 15 1011,
111ιὰ Epod 3). It is intended, as Newman says, to make the occasion slightly
ridiculous, to represent both himself and the lady as having made too much os it.

The παλινῳδία 01 Stesichorus, which added to the legend 01 Troy the famous
variation that it was only a phantom in Helen’s shape that Paris carried from
Mycenae, is mentioned by Plato, Phaedr. ²43 A, who quotes the fust three
