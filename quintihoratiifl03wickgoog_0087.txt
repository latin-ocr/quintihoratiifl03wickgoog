sor the Ode in nc. ²9· when Augustus, according to the statement both of
Suetonius (Oct. 28) and oi Dio Cassius (52. 1), entertained the thought oi aban·
doning the supreme power which had just fully come into his hands. Dio gives
a speech oi Maecenas on that occasion, in which he uses the very allegory of the
Ode. As Macleane remarks. this may prove too much. It is as certain as can be
that Horace drew bis image not from any speech oi Maecenas. but from Alcaeus.
Maecenas or Dio may more probably have taken theirs from Horace.

The image oi a ship sor the State is an old one. See. inter alia, Aesch. Sept. c.
T. 1.Soph. O. T. 25, Plat. Resp. p. 488, Theognis, 671-682. ”
