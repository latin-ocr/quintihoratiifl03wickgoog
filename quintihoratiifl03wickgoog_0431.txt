lines having fallen out. It will be seen, on examinationi, that the diiii·
culties of 4. 8. 17 have been exaggerated3 and, at any rate, in the
absence of any indication oi such a quaternary division, either in the

the chief recent editors have not thought it necessary to alter the Ode
in obedience to the canon. Steiner pointed out that, whatever may
have been the case with the Odes which are composed in conpleta
there are but five other Odes besides 4. 8 (omitting, again, 3. 12)
which are μονόστιχα, oroi uniform metre, and that this is too sinnii an
area ior such an important induction.
