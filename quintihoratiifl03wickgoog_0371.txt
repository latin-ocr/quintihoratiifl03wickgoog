HORATII EPODON LIBER.

u—n————

EPODE 1.

‘Yon Maecenas. are going to expose yonrself to all the dangers of war for
Caesar’s sake-what think yon 1 shall do, to whom you areas much as Caesar
can be to you? lshall follow you 1ο the world's end. Do you ask what good
1 can do? lahall be in less terror if 1 am with you than 111 arn absent. Ihave
no seltish motive. Your bounty has made me rich enough already. 1 don't want
more either to hoard orto squander.'

This Epode is usually referred (after the Scholiast) to the spring of nc. 31, when
Augustus, according to Dio (50. 11), before setting ont to Actium, summoned the
chief men of Rome, senators and equites, 10 meet him at Brundisium : 101101νὸ101
τι σνμπράξωσιν αὐτῷ, rode δ’ ὅπως μηδὲν μονωθέντα mygdoniae, τό τε μέγιστον inor
dadelfvyror τοΐι ἀνθρώποιο ὅτι nol τὸ πλεῖστον nal τὸ κράτιστον τῶν Ῥωμαίων ὁμογνω·
μονοῦν ἔ χοι. 11 would be probable that Maecenas would go with the rest, although
he must have returned 10 Rome and not gone on to Actium. as Dio (51. 3) speaks
of his having been left in charge of Rome and Italy during the campaign.
Mr. Dyer, however (in the Classical Museum. vol. ii. p. ao foll.. and in the D ct.
Biog. s. v. Maecenas). argues strongly for the view that the Epode belongs to the
war against Sextus Pompeius in the year ac. 36, when there is reason 11100110. de
Bell. civ. Β. p. 729) to believe that Maecenas was in Sicily with Octavianus. He
thinks that Horace actually accompanied him as he proposes to do, and that the
otherwise unidentified escape from shipwreclr in the poet's life (⁴ Sicula Palinurus
unda,' Od. 3, 4. 28 q. v.) belongs to this expedition.
