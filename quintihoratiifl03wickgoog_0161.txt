HORATII CARMINUM

Iam te sequetur: currit enirn ferox
Aetas et illi, quos tibi dempserit,
Apponet annos; iam proterva
Fronte petet Lalage maritum:
Dilecta, quantum non Pholoe fugax,
Non Chloris albo sic humero nitens,
Ut pura nocturno renidet
Luna mari, Cnidiusve Gyges,
Quem si puellarum insereres choro,
Mire sagaces falleret hospites
Discrimen obscurum solutis
Crinibus ambiguoque voltu.
