LIB. 1. OD. 10.

More palaestrae,
Te canem, magni Iovis et deorum
Nuntium curvaeque lyrae parentem,
Callidum, quidquid placuit, iocoso
Condere furto.
Te, boves olim nisi reddidisses
Per dolum amotas, puerum minaci
Voce dum terret, viduus pharetra
Risit Apollo.
Quin et Atridas duce te superbos
Ilio dives Priamus relicto
Thessalosque ignes et iniqua Troiae
Castra fefellit.
Tu pias laetis animas reponis
Sedibus virgaque levem coerces .
Aurea turbam, superis deorum
Gratus et imis.
