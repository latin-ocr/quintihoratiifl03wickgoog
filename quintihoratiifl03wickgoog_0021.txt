assigned by Ritter and by Usener to the 9th century. It forms part
of a quarto volume, which contains also Servius’ Commentary on
Virgil, two Treatises on Rhetoric‚ Bede's History, and Ovid's Meta·
morphoses. It is imperfect, omitting all the Epistles and the Satires,
with the exception of the first two and part of the third os Book I,
‚besides large portioris of the Odes. The Odes are not arranged
in their usual order, the copyist having apparently started with the
intention of an arrangement according to metres, for he begins with
nineteen Sapphic Odes. These follow the common order, though
the distinction of Books is not marked They are succeeded by some
of the Epodes‚ then by the Cann. Sec, then by the remaining Odes
and Epodes‚ also in their usual order. The Ars Poet. 1-440 follows
the Epodes‚ then Sat. 1. r,2 and part of 3. The omissions in the
Odes and Epodes are as follows z-of whole Odes in Book 1, Odes ’
3-7, 9,11, 33 and 343 in Book III‚Ode3; and of Book lV‚Odes3
