164 HORATII CARMINUM

ODE XX.

⁸ Hoaacz will stay no longer on earth; he will mount into the clear air os heaven
and laugh at his detractors. He whom the envious world despises, but whom
Maecenas loves, will not die the common death oi men. Already he seels himself
changing to a swan. All the world shall see him and hear his music: funeral rites
have no meaning lor him!

The Ode may be described as an amplification ol Ennius' epitaph on himself :

‘Nemo me lacrymis decoret, neque funera fletu
Faxit. Cur? volito vivus per nra virum!

Compare Virgil's imitation os the same (G. 3. 8) ι

‘Tentanda via est qua me quoque possim
Tollere humo victorque virum volitare per ora?

The Ode doubtless owes its place at the end os a Book to its general reference to
Horace and his lyric same: but it does not look asif it had been written sor such
a purpose, as Od. 3. 30, Epp. 1. ao. lts feeling seems really to lie in vv. 4-8.
