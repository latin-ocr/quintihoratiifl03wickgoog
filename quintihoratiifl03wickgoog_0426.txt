32, rwnex or Marnas

In two instances, in Od. 1. 15. 24 and 36, Horace returns to the
use os Catullus, and has a trochee as the ‘ basis,' ‘Teucer et Sthenelus
sciens,' ‘Ignis Iliacas domos!

It employs three kinds oi verses :-

a being repeated twice.

It is obvious that we have here variations ol two movements ;
verse β repeats and amplifies the movement of the first half of a,
verse γ repeats the dactylic movement ol the second hals, putting
the trochees after instead ol before it. This consideration proves
that although to the ear the movement ol β and of the first half of a
is iambic, it was in idea a sequence ol trochees preceded by an
unemphatic syllable or ‘anacrusis' The anacrusis is as often short
as long in the fragments ol Alcaeus and Sappho. In Horace it is
occasionally short, but more rarely in β than in 2, and never in either
in Book iv.

Alcaeus had admitted a spondee in the place ol the second trochee.
Horac'e made the spondee imperative, see on Od. 3. 5. 27, 3. 23. 18.

The division oi the two halves os the line is marked by a caesura,
which is only violated twice, *in Od. 1. 37. 24 ‘Mentemque lymphatam
Mareotic0,' and 4. 24. 27 ‘Spectandus in certamine Martio? There
