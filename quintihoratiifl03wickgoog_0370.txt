ΑΗ the indicatiorss os date to be discovered in the poems them-
selves fix thern to the first period os his lise as an author. Their
references to current polities, both posim-ely, as in the allusions to the
war with Sextus Pompeius, and negatively, in the vagueness with
which they dent with the genens situation at home <see on Epod⁴
7 and 16), belong to the decade between the hott-les ns Philippi and
Actium* We notice in their style indications which point the sante
way—occasionn! harshnesses os construction, a redundancy of
epithets. a tendency even in the best poenis to poetical common-
place, we may add a grossness os subject and language, which his
mature :aste would have pmned away. The Epodes stand with the
Satires ar the opening of Horaee's literary life—not unconneeted
with them in tone, nor in their literary antecedent-s, nor in their
treatment in his hands* The Roman Satirist, he tells us, looked, sor
all but the poetica! form os his composition, ιο Greek Comedyu ln
the Epode he has returned to the persona! lzmpoon. the earliest use

Comedy, according to Aristode (Poet. l, a), was the development.
1t is in the taste which leads him sor models to Lucilius and Archi-
lochus, rather than in any bitterness os special poenis, that we may
trace probably his own description already referred to (Epp, ι, a. ⁵¹ 5
see Introd. to Books i-iii, 5 1) os the personal motives that first drove
him to write poetry. In any case it is character-istic of the man that
his Satires should mettow and lii-manime into the Epistles, md that
the Epodes should drop so early their ὶσμβακὴ lilia, and sosren ancl
generalize into the Odes. The process in both cases is nearly
complete before the name ol* the composition is changed.

Horace speaks himself (Epod. ¹4) of the Book as preparing sor
publication, md as having occupied some space of time iu com-
position. The date of its publication is generally held to be fixed by
the relation between Epod. 9 and Od. r. 37, to the year nc. 31-30.
