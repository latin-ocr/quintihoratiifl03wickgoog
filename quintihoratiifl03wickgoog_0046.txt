antecedent to the composition. But if this difference must make us
cautious in drawing sweeping conclusions as to the other Books from
the obviously consclous and artistic arrangement¹ of Book iv, we may
at least guther that Horace contemplated a collection of poems being
read continuously in such a way that the effect of a particular poern
could be heightened or weakened by the sequence in which it was
plaeed; and we may leam something also of the principles of taste
which would be likely to gulde him in arranging other collections.

3. Α marked feature of Horace's style is the irony with which he
professes to shrink from enthusiasm‚ to be the poet of mirth and love,
‘non praeter solitum levis,' surprised, it may be, occasionally into
serious subjecta but recovering himself before he has done injury
to a theme for which he is unfit! It is this irony as much as the
mere desire for variety that makes him scatter his political poems at
such wide intervals. Itis this, as we shall see, that colours the pre·
lude to Book iv; and though the relation between r. 1 and 1. a is not
worked out so fullyas that between 4. r, 2, 3 and 4. 4, 5, it is substan-
tially the same. Od. 1. 1 has of course a relation to the whole three
Books3 but it is notan accident that a poem, in which his political
faith is set forth most fully, should follow immediately on his opening
apology for verse-writing as a taste not more unaccountable than the
thousand others that divide mankind.

On its artistic side-that is where it affects his manner as a .

principle of taste, rather than as a characteristic of his own feelings or
aprudential consideration of the judgrnent of the world-this irony
is nearly connected with another feature of his style which will be
noticed on a. 19 (Introd. and on v. 31), 3. 5. 56, and 4. 2. 57: 1
mean his affectation, in poems where we have been wrought higher
than usual, of a rather dull, even conventional, ending, as though the
passion ought to die away in a diminuendo before the strain ceascs.
When we are looking for exemplifications of either of these feelings
in the position of a particular Ode, we must remember that they may
pass again by shades hard to define into the mere sense of the relief
afforded by contrast, an unwillingness to dwell too long on any one
note. An instance, where we cannot doubt an artistic purpose in the
juxtaposition, and where this purpose seems to hesitare between the
first and second feeling which we have traced, is robe seen in 1. 37,
38, where we must notice that the slight Ode, with its picture of
