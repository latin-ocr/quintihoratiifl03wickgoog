LIBER. EPOD. 5.

Senem, quod omnes rideant, adulterum
Latrent Suburanae canes
Nardo perunctum, quale non perfectius
Meae laborarint manus- 60

Cum palla, tabo munus imbutum, novam 65
Incendio nuptam abstulit.

Atqui nec herba nec latens in asperis

’ Radix seiellit me locis.

Indormit unctis omnium cubilibus
Oblivione pellicum.—

Ah ah! solutus ambulat veneficae
Scientioris carmine.
