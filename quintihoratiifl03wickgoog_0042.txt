politica. The names are often used merely as poetical expressions of
distance, the extreme North (as in Od. a. ao), or generally ior the
northern tribes, as the supposed representativcs of the manlier virtues
(as in Od. 3. 24) or as the objects os the vague fears of Roman states·
men (Od. a. 11. ι).

The Daci are mentioned by Dio 51. aa as offering their services to
Octavianus, and when their terms were declined by him j0ining
Antony, to whom, however, they rendered little assistance, as they
were quarrelling amongst themselves (see Od. 3. 6. 13).

In nc. 30, M. Crassus, at the bidding ol Octavianus, marched
northward from Macedonia, and won some victories over the Daci
and Bastarnae as well as the Moesi, sor which he was allowed a
triumph, Dio 51. ²3·

From the Epitome os Livy (Β. 135) it appears that Crassus was
again fighting in Thrace in ac. 25.

Florus (4. ra,§18) speaks ol Lentulus driving the Daci beyond
the Danube, but no date is given. His words may be worth quoting
sorbis mention os Cotiso (Od. 3. 8. 18) and for the illustration of
Horace's expression ‘intra praescriptum equitare,’ Od. a. 9. 23:
‘Daci montibus inhaerent ; Cotisonis¹ regis imperio quoties concretus
gelu Danubius iunxerat ripas decurrere solebant et vicina populari.
Visum est Caesari Augusto gentem aditu difficillimam submovere.
Misso igitur Lentulo ultra ulteriorem repulit ripam: citra praesidia
constituit, sic tunc Dacia non victa sed submota atque dilata est.
Sarmatae patentibus campis inequitant3 ethos per eundem Lentulum
prohibere Danubio satis fuit!

It is obvious that there is nothing here to lix the date oi the
debated Ode 3. 8. The victory os Crassus will satisly the expres-
sions of ν. 18, and so would the victory of Lentulus but this last is
itsels undated.

The only political event connected with the Eastern Scythians
which is alluded to in these Books, is their interference on behall
os Phraates, which will bc notioed immediately under the Parthian
affairs.
