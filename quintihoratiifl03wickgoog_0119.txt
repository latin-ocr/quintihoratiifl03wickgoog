82 HORATll CARMINUM

the shore near Tarentum. Which is most likely, that a speaker on the shore of
Apulia should commend a passing sailor to the care of ‘Neptune the warder of
sacred Tarentum,¹ or tbat one speaking at Tarentum shall apostrophiae Archytas
in his burial place on the ‘litus Matinum'f The question seems to be really
settled by the second local reference in r. 26. The woods about Venusia are near
enough to stand for the ‘inland woods' on the shore just north of the Aufidus, but
they would not occur naturally if the soene were at Tarentum.

The Ode consists of at least two parts: some moralizing on the unirersallty of
Death‚ connected in some way with the fate of Archytas, and the petition of an
unburied corpse for the handful of saud which would enable it to cross the Styx.
What is tbe relation between the two? The oldest answer was that the unburied
body was that of Archytas himself, who (we must suppose) had been drowned and
cast ashore during a voyage on the Adriatic. The Scholiasta consider tbe Ode a
monologue, the shade of Archytas addressing itself in the first twenty lines, and
appealing to a passing sailor in the remainder. The commoner view makes it a
dialogue begun by the sailor who finds the body of the philosopher, and moralizes
upon it till he is interrupted by the shade of Archytas. Where the break takes
place is a question still to be settled Verses 7. 15, 17, and 21,have all been pro·
posed. A chief motive for throwing the division as late at least as v. 15.= is to

' prevent the appeal of v. 14 ‘ Iudice te non sordidus auctor Naturae verique' from
being addressed by Archytas to tbe sailor. Newman, on tbe contrary, hears iu l

· the appeal so addressed a very keynote of the Ode. He thinks that ‘the poem is
written in the spirit of Lucian to ridicule the mixture of old mythology and new
philosophy in Southern Italy. where the Pythagorean doctrines were widely dif-
fused. The sailor is presumed, by the shade of Archytas, to be an adherent of
Pythagoras? ·

Dillenburger. dividing at r. 17, thinks that the point of the Ode is the mutual
exposure bya philosopher and a man of the world of the vanity of their respec-
tive pursuits,-the philosopher measuring the saud and dreaming of metem-
psychosis, the trader so intent on his pursuit of gain as to be unwilling to spare a
minute to render the last service to his brother mah-both losing sight of death,
and of their common humanity. The chief difficulty in the way of this interpre-
tation is supposed to lie in the rendering of vv. 2, 3. Can 'parva munera pulveris
te cohibent' mean ‘the want of the gift of a little dust keeps you fast'? Or has
Horace, when he makes Archytas ask for burial iu v. ²3· forgotten that he had
already buried him in v. a? Perhaps we may say that neither Horace nor
Archytas vouch for the fact of a due sprinkling of dust. They are the sailor’s
words; and he is thinking at the time of the small compass to which the far·
reaching mind of the philosopher is shrunk, not of the sufficiency or insufficiency
of his burial. Archytas replies that his case is worse eren than the sailor had
supposed, for he still lacks the sand that would give his shade rest.

Those interpretcrs who. for this or other reasons, hold that the unburied body is
of some other than Archytas, explain the address of the early lines by placing the
soene of the Ode iu sight of Archytas' tomb. There is still a question whether it
is a dialogue or a monologue. The interpretation which Orelli gives from an
anonymous friend, and which lre favours himself, makes the contrast between
vv. 1-20, which contain reflections on the common doom of mortality suggested
to a passing voyager by the sight of the philosopher's tomb, and the remainder of
the Ode, in which the voice of an unburied corpse on the shore is supposed to
interrupi his moralizing, and in its urgent appeal to suggest that, after all, death is
not the hardest of fates.

Ritter imagines the Ode to have been suggested by the drownfng of some
