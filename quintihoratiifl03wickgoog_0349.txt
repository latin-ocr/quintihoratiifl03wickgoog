LIB. IV. OD. 12. 303

the Ode was written near the same time as the last, in the penitet expressions ‘ Ut
tamen noris quibus advoceris Gaudiis.’ ιι. 13. ‘Ad quae si properas gaudia.' 12. st.
The use οἱ ‘gaudia' is sufficiently unusuel to be noticeable, and to occur to a
writer's mind a second time. but less likely to hare been repeated et a distance ol
time. The Scholiasts and inscriptions oi MSS. call Virgilius ‘unguentarius‘
‘mercator‚' ‘negotiaton’ ‘medicus Neronum! nn look as ii they were inserences
more or less clumsy from words os the Ode itseli; but the general impressiou, in
spite oi the temptation to identiiy him with the only well-known Virgilius, that he
was a different and later person, is os some value.

¹The substance of the Ode is very parallel to one oi Catullus (13). in which he
bids Fabullus come to supper. end bring with him all the materials seve the
unguent, which he will supply himself. and which he promises shall be so delicious
that Fabullus will wish that he were all nese.
