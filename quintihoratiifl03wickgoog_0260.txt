ODE XIX.

Ι(ἷοιιιι, Telephus, enough of your antiquarian lore3 attend to the ruore practioal
question where and when we are to sup this cold night! Then, with a sudden
change, he fancies the banquet already prepared (cp. ι. 7. ιι toll.. ι. ιι. 18 foll.):
‘We have to drinlr the new month, und our friend Murena. the newly-elected
Augur. Strilre up with pipe and harp ; no grudging, scatter the reses. Let morose
old Lycus hear our riot next door, und his ill-matched young wife. We are better
matched here. Telephus and Rhode.1 and Glycera!

Telephus is a mythological name which Horeee used before in 1. 13 (see Introd.
to that Ode), aud uses again iu 4 ιι. ιι. Itis of course possible that a real
person is intended in this case, though it is hard to see why his name should
be concealed. Ritter hits upon the rhetorician Heliodorus. the companion of
Horace's journey to Brundisium (⁸ Graecorum longe doctissimus.' Sat. 1. 5. 3), with
whose profession such antiquarium questions would suit, and whose name he sancies Ι
ιο be etymologically played on in ‘Telephus' (τῆλε odor).

For Murena see on 2. ι. 5and ι. ιο Introd.
