ODE XIII.

‘an gods have heard my prayers. Lyce. I have my revenge. You are turning
into an old woman, yet would lain hide it. and drink and plny and love es ever.
Love turns away lrom your wrinlrles; nor will purple gauzes and jewellery brIng
back your youth. Where is the beauty that I rememben the charms which made
you second only to Cinara I—Cinara. who died in her prime. while yon live on lor
ever, sor young men to moralize on and laugh at!

The Ode is a sequel to 3. ιο, in theh he complained ol Lyce's high airs, and
named her not to try her Iover's patience too long.
