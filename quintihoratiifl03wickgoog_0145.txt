HORATll CARMINUM

Vix una sospes navis ab ignibus,
Mentemque lymphatam Mareotico
Redegit in veros timores

Caesar, ab Italia volantem
Remis adurgens, accipiter velut
Molles columbas aut leporem citus
Venator in campis nivalis

Fatale monstrum: quae generosius
Perire quaerens nec muliebriter
Expavit ensem nec latentes
