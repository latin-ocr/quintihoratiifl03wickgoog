LIB. Ι. OD. ¹4·

ons niu.

Tne ship addressed has just escaped from a storm, its mast broken, its hull
shattered, its sails in ribands. The harbour is in sight. The wind is rising again.
Itis warned not to driit back into a sea in which it cannot live.

Quintilian (8. ό. 44) makes the Ode his illustration ol the meaning oi the term
‘allegoria' ‘Ut “O navis referent,” eto, totusque ille Horatii locus quo navem
pro republica, fluctuum tempestates pro bellis civilibus, portum pro pace atque
concordia dicit? And the poem oi Alcaeus, which looks like its model, was
believed by the ancients to be an allegorical description oi the political troubles of
Mit lene:-

γ dominnm τῶν ἀνέμων στάσιν·
τὸ μὶν γὰρ ἔνθεν κῦμα κυλίνδεται,
τὸ Ννθεν· ἅμμα δ’ dr τὸ μέσσον
ndi φοροὺμεθσ σὺν μελαίνᾳ,
χειμῶνι μόχθεντεε μεγάλῳ μάλα·
περ μίν γὰρ enno· luronldor ἔχει,
luipo· tt πᾶν (ἄδηλον ἤδη
roal hinist μέγαλαι κατ’ uiro.
χόλωσι δ’ ἄγκυραι . . .
(Fr. 18 Bergk.)

As longas we are content with Quintilian's general exposition, all is simple. The
allegory is satisfied when the commonwealth, in danger os relapsing into civil war,
has become a sea-wearied ship, driiting back into the storm. The masts, the sails,
the pine oi Pontus, the Cyclades, belong to the ship, and we must not look for
their exact couuterparts in the State. Here, as with other allegories, we are beset
with difficulties the moment we attempt to fit the details more exactly. It has
been argued. from vv. 17, 18, that Horace speaks of the ship as ii he had himself
leit it (but see notes on those verses), and that the subject oi the Ode must,
therefore, be not the State but the Republican party. Why, others ask, is ita
Pontio piae, not some other—idean. perhaps, as more suitable to the mythical
origin oi Rome? Acron suggested the answer, which has since been developed
into a whole theory ol the purpose os the Ode. Pompey was the conqueror of
Mithridates of Pontus. The ship, therefore, represents the inmunes ot' lris son,
Sextus Pompeius, whom Horace would dissuade from embarking again in war
with Octavianus atter the treaty oi Misenum, rac. 39.

The difficulties os interpretation seemed so great to Muretus, Dacier, and Bentley,
that they refused to allow the Ode to be allegorical at all.

On our view there will be nothing to fix it to a definite date. The ship is in
sight oi harbour. This distinguishes the Ode from Epodes vii. and xvi. (see the
Introductions to them). It is not yet moored beyond the resch oi the wind. So
long as the most timid politician could see in any movement a thought ol renewed
resistance to the rule which had saved Rome srom anarehy. so long might Horace
have rented his iears, or appealed to the seara ol others by this allegory.
