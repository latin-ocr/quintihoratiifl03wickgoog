λ. Ρο110, 7972. This is one 01 the MSS. which contains the Mavor-

To these Keller and Holder add a Paris MS. (7975) 01 the 11th

It has been already suggested, that the only method by which con·
clusive evidence upon questions 01 01000100 reading could 00 gathered
from MSS. 01 such late date, would be by grouping them in families
or ‘recensions’ each family being made by its common readings to
bear witness to some archetype 01 10000 greater antiquity than the copies
which we now possess. This has been attempted by Keller, and
with more completeness hy Holder¹. A and a, >t and l, φ 000 ψ, as
we have seen, have been supposed to be severally related in this way,
and the readings 01 their imagined archetypes are indicated by Holder
by the signs A'‚ λ’, F. With his fuller ‘apparatus criticus' 00 100
Satires and Epistles, the process is carried still further, and the result
is, to the extent that unisorm readings can be obtained, a certain
number 01 conjecturally restored MSS. 01 100 yth and 8th centuries.
These and the other solitary representatives 01 older MSS. arc again
grouped into three classes.
The first 01 these is distinguished as containing, with many 100110 01
carelessness, and with a certain number 01 grammatical corrections ,
