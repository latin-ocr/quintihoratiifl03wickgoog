Ο DE XXVII.

In Od. 1. 18 the poet had recommended moderatiori in the use oswine on mornl
and religious grounds. Here his object is the same though the tone is lighter.
The Ode is a dramatis sketch ol a bouquet which is degenerating into a drunken
brawl. Horace interrupts it by an appeul, playt'ul in its mixture oi the Bacchis
hierophnnt with the genial poet oi good living. The company would reply to
their monitor by filling his glass. ‘On one condition only,' he says, and diverts
them at once iroru his own lecture and their rising quarrel to an absorbing interest
in the love affairs os Megilla's brother. his bashiulness, bis imegined confideuces,
his mysteriously hopeless sate.

1t is at least an ingenious suggestion oi Ritter's that the ‘Opuntiae irater
Megillae’ is the same as the Xanthias Phoceus os od. 2. 4, whom Horace banters
on his love ior a slave girl (the ‘Charybdis' on this view oi this Ode), neither
‘fidelis' it we read the irony nright, nor ‘lucro aversa'3 see the Introd to that
Ode.

spired the beginning oi this Ode :-
