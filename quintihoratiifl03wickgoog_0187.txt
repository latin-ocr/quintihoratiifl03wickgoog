ODE XVl.

‘Percu is (at times at leastl the prayer 01 all men, though they do not go the
way to liud it. Gold and purple will not buy it, Grosphus; neither wealth nor
rank banish care; and meantime very little suffices 101 a happy lise it the heart is
free from sear nnd desire. Moderated desires, not hurrying from place to place,
are the means to avoid care. Gowhere you will you cannot escape yourself. Care
boards the best appointed trireme and keeps up with the fleetest horsemau. Enjoy
the present and don't think 01 the future. lt troubles come, smile and be patient
and they will be the lighter. Unmixed happiness is not to be loolred 101 : Achilles
had glory, but with it an early death; Tithonus a long lit'e and the weariness 01
old age. What you lack 1 may perhaps have. as you have what I lack. Yon
have flocks and herds and purple garments‚ and I have my little farm, my muse,
and a heart to despise my critics!

‘Pence and happiness depend ou ourselves, uot on things outside 01 us.' ‘Quod
petis, hic est, Est Ulubris, animus si te nou delicit aequus,' Epp. r. 11. ²9·
Grosphus is doubtless the person whom Horace commends to locius in Epp. 1.
ra. 22-24:-
‘Utere Pompeio Grospho. et, siquid petet, ultro
Deser; nil Grosphus nisi vemm orabit et aequum.
Vilis amicorum est annona. bonis ubi quid deest!

We gether from this Ode that he wasa man 01 wealth. and. from both Ode aud
Epistle, that his property was in Sicily.
