ODE XXII.

‘Dr me tuentur: Dis pietas mea
Et Musa cordi est! Od. 1. 17. 13.

The protection from common dangers accorded to the poet's floclrs is extendcd
to himself. As a child, ‘non sine Dis animosus‚' he is covered by the wood-
pigeons from the snakes and bears of Mount Vultur (Od. 3. 4). Mercury snatches
him froin the solly and danger ol civil war into which his boyish enthusiasm had
carried him (Od. a. 7). Faunus (Od. a. 17) wards oli from him the falling tree.
Now a woli flies from him as he wanders unarmed iu the woods near his Sabine
sarm.

We may compare the Ode with the Epistle (1. ιο) addresscd to the same Fuscus,
‘Urbis amatorem Fuscum salvere iubemus Ruris amatores! ‘Fuge magna‚'
v. 3²· ‘A harmless, pious lile is the true secret oi salcty and oi happiness! The
Ode dresses this doctrine in the garb ol poetry and religion-the Epistle in that oi
philosophy and worldly wisdom. Aristius Fuscus is an intimate friend ol Horace.
Epp. 1. ιο. 2-4 ‘caetera poene gemelli Fraternis animis quicquid negat alteret alter
Annuimus pariter vetuli notique columbi! He appears in S. 1. 10. 83, amongst
the critias by whose judgment Horace will abide, in S. r. 9. as the friend who
wickedly escapes, leaving the poet ‘sub cultro? He is called by Aer. on Epp.
