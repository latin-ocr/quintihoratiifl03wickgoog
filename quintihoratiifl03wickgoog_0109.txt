HORATII CARMINUM

ODE XXIII.

‘llou ily from me, chloe. like a t'rightened kid to its dam. 1 am not a tiger or
lion going to eat you. lIou are too old for such shyness.’

We have possibly part ol a Greek original to this Ode in a fragment ol
Anacreon (Fr. 51 Bergk).⁴-

άγανῶι ott τι νεβρὸν νεοθηλέα
γαλαθηνὸν ὅστ’ ἓν ὕλῃ· erpoinum
ὀπολοιφθεὴ tva μητρὸι levoion.

VITAS hinnuleo me similis, Chloe,
Quaerenti pavidam montibus aviis
Matrem non sine vano
Auratum et siluae metu.
Nam seu mobilibus veris inhorruit
Adventus soliis seu virides rubum
DImovere lacertae,
Et corde et genibus tremit.
