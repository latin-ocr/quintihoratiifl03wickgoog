THE SCHOLIASTS. xxiii

which would point to their being later than the prohibition of heathen
ceremonies by Theodosius in n.o..391 ; we find (unless these be inter·
polations) the names of the Goths (on Od. 4. 15. 22) and, according
to one MS. of the Huns (on Od. 2. 11. r), and a hint perhaps of the

desolation of Italy by the barbarians (on Od. 3. 4. 16); and we find,
subject to the same provis0, references to Priscian (5th century) on
Epp. 2. r. 228, and to Priscian's teacher Theoctistus on Sat. 1. 5. 97.
Itis mainly on those grounds that Keller distinguishes the Acron who
was one of the commentators used by Porphyrion from the composer
or composers ol the Scholia which now bear the name, and which
were composed by some one who had Porphyrion's commentary in
his hands and used it largely. These Pseudo-Acronian Scholia he
relegates to the 5th century. Upon grounds on which it is less easy
to leel secure in following him, he divides thern into two parts; the
first (up to the beginning of the Fourth Book of the Odes with part oi
those in the Fourth Book and most of the Epodes) belonging to the
earlier hals of the century; the remainder he places in the second half,
arrd identifies as their author Fabius Planciades Fulgentius,a gram·
marian of that date, one of whose works, three books of mythology,
is found with no mark of a new author on the same MS. with the
Schol. Acron.

The so-called ‘Commentator Cruquianus' is notan independent
authority, the name being given to a medley of notes, in the main a
transcript or paraphrase of Acron and Porphyrion, printed by
Cruquius from marginal or interlinear annotations on his Blandi-

nian MSS.

It may be convenient for purposes of reference to add a chrono-
logical list of the chief edilibus of Horace earlier than the present
century (chiefly from lilitscherlich).

The ‘editio princeps ⁹ is not certainly known: the title is usually given
to an edition without name or date, which is supposed to have
been published by Zarotus at Milan in 1470. The first edition,
which contains a commentary bya modern scholar of name, is
that of Laudibus (Cristoforo Landino, born at Florence 1424,
died 1504), printed at Florence in 1482, and at Venice in the
same year. An edition, published at Venice in 1492, contained,
besides, notes by Mancr'nellur (Antonio Mancinelli, born at Velletri
in 1452, a teacher at Orvieto).
