COMPLEMENTARY INFINITIVE. 379

‘interpellet durare,' S. 2. 6. 128.

In the solloning instances the leading verb seems to be still more
complete in itself, and the sense os ‘purpose' (which in prose would
have been expressed by means oi a gerundive or supine or final clause)
to be thrown more entirely upon the infinitive :-

‘te persequor lrange1e‚' Od. 1. 23. 10.

‘pecus egit visere montes,’ Od. 1. 2. 8.

‘quern virum sumis celebrare,’ Od.1.1a3 (cp. ‘res gestas sumis

scribere,’ Epp. 1. 3. 7).

‘tradam ventis portare‚’ Od. 1. 26. 3 (cp. Virg. Aen. 1. 3¹9 ‘dede- '

ratque comam diffundere ventis ’).
‘me expetit urere‚' Epod. 11. 5.

2. With Adjectives.

It is this use which, though by no means confined to Horace
among the poets (cp. Virg. F. 5. 1 ‘boni inflare,’ Aen. 6. 264 ‘prae-
stantior ciere‚' etc), and not without precedent even in the best Latin
prose (ior Cicero uses ‘paratus’ (cp. Hor. Epod. 1. 3) with an infini-
tive), is yet sufficiently frequent with him to lonn a noticeable feature
ot his style. The easiest cases are those of a participle (which posses
into a verbal adjective) from a simple verb which would require or
readily admit a complementary infinitive. Such are

‘sciens flectere,' Od. 3. 7. 25, compared with ‘nescius cedere: Od.
1. 6. 6.

‘metucns tangere‚' 0113. 19. 16, with ‘timidus perire,' Od. 4. 9. 52 ;
cp. ‘audax perpeti‚’ Od. 2. 3. 25.

‘doctus' as a participle, Od. 3. 6. 27 (‘ institutus‚’ Od. 3. 8. 11); as
an adj. in ‘docta psallere,’ Od. 4. 13· 7, ‘ludere doctior,’ Od. 3.
24. 56. Then we have ‘indoctus serre,' Od. 2. 6. 2, ‘indocilis
pati’ Od.1.1. 18.

‘dignus' (=‘qui meret ⁹), with an active infinitive, Epp. 1. 10. 48,
with a passive, Od. 3. 22. 6, Sat. 1. 3. 24, 1. 4. 3, 25, 2. 10. 72,
A. P. 283, 283; ‘indigna’ A. Ρ. 232.

‘idoneus dare,' Epp. 2. 26. ra. ‘Fruges consumere nati’ (Epp. 1. 2)
is a step beyond this. ‘Leviora tolli,' Od. 2. 4. 22, and ‘cereus
flecti‚’ A. Ρ. 16 3, also belong here, the adjectives being only more
or less coloured forms oi‘sacilis‚' and the construction arising
from the conversion ol the impersonal ‘lacile est hunc flectere'
into a personal ‘hic facilis est ilecti.¹ We may add, perhaps,
‘vultus nimium lubricus aspici‚' Od. r.19.8,=‘quem lubricum

est aspicere.'
