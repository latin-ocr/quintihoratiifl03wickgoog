HORATII CARhllh'UM

Cedes et exstructis in altum >l

Divitiis potietur heres.
Divesne prisco natus ab Inacho,
Nil interest, an pauper et infima

De gente sub divo moreris,

Victima nil miserantis Orci.
Omnes eodem cogimur, omnium
Versatur urna scrius ocius .

Sors exitura et nos in aeternum

Exsilium impositura cumbae.

‘No need to blush, Xanthias. though you love a slave girl. Achilles had his
Briseis, and Ajax his Tecmessm even Agamemnon, the conqueror ol Troy, could
not withstand Cassandra. Who knows but Phyllis too is some born princess:
one so constant and so indifferent to money can spring t'rom uo vulgar stock. Nay,
dou't suspect my praisea, 1 am close on sorty.'

We can hardly be wrong iu supposing that, with the exception ol her pretty
iace and figure, the praises ol Phyllis are meant to be interpreted ironically. The
moclr heroic tone ol th'e list oi precedente (cp.0d.1.16,1ntrod.‚andEpod.3),
the ‘regium certe‚' and the contempt implied ior her real birth, 'scelesta plebe,’
might be merely plnysul; but considering the topics ol praise, ‘sic fidelem, sic
lucro aversum,' there is hardly feeling enough in their expression, standing as they
do between the levity oi stanzas 4 and 6, to redeem the playlulness irom the sting
os irony.
