HORATII CARMINUM

ODE Xl.

‘Do not go to the Astrologers, leuconod. Better bearlit'e as it comes3 enjoy
the present, and think as little as possible about the future'

On the ‘mathematici’ see Dict. Ant. s. v. Astrologia; ‘genus hominum potenti·
bus infidum sperantibus fallax quod in civitate nostra et vetabitur semper et
retinebitur,' Tac. Hist. r. aa. Horace himself was not above au interest in the
superstition ol the day, see Od. a. 17, and Sat. 1. 6. ¹13·

The name ot leuconoe' is chosen doubtless in part at least as a pretty sounding
name which suits the Choriambic metra, as Neobule and Liparaeus suit the
Ionic a minore of Od. 3. ra. It is possible also that Horace may have looked to
its etymology. but it is hard sor us to say whether it would have conveyed a com-
plimentary sense or the rercrse; ‘candida' or ‘clara mente’ say some oi his
editors, ‘empty-minded’ say others. Pindar's tonat φρένα, Pyth. 4. 194. which is
quoted iu support os the latter view, seems rather to imply ‘malignity' than
·tolly.·
