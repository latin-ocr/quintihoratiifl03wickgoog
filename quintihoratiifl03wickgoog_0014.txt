several unities. ΙΙ my efforts teach a young reader
that he has not read a poem properly unless he has
attempted to do this sor himself, is they make him
less ready to admit in any poet, and especially in

Horace, the existence of ‘inert' epithets, and pur-
poseless digressions or amplificationS, Ι shall not
complain that he should come to trust for the ex·
planation os his difficulties to his own imagination
rather than to mine.

Some account os the materials at our disposal for
the settlement of the text of Horace, and os the prin·
ciples on which Ι have endeavoured, where it was
necessary to do so, to exercise my own judgment,
will be sound in the General Introduction. ln the
matter ol orthography l have followed Orelli.

l have to ackuowledge much kind help and many
uselul hints lrom friends, especially from A. 0.
Prickard, Esq, Fellow and Tutor of New College,
who has been always ready with suggestive criticism,
and to whom Ι was indebted sor special assistance
in writing the notes on the Fourth Book of the Odes.
Ι owe also to his labour, as well as to the kind
courtesy of the Provost and Fellows of Queen's Col-
lege‚ the collation ol the valuable Queen's College
MS. which appears in an Appendix to this volume.
