ODE XXV.

In this Ode, as in a. 19. Horace has tried to catch the inspiration oi a Greek
dithyramb. In that one he professes to recall the effects which the sight ot
Bacchus had upon him: in the present one he is actually under the infinence ot
the afflatus. ‘He is hurried away, whither he knows not: his eyes are opened on
strange caverna and river-hanla and woods. His tongue will be loosed ina
moment to sing no humble theme, and in no common strain, the glories os Caesar:
he follows the god, sor he must, and it is delightiul, but it is seariul too!

The glory ot Caesar ia only mentioned as the subject oi the coming burst ot
song; but the place oi honour given to it is in effect the celebration which is
promised. See 1. 6, Introd.
