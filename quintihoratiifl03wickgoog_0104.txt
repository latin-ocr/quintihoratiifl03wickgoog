ODE XXI.

Corinnae Catull. 34 ‘Dianae sumus in fide: etc.

Several occasions have been imagined lor this Ode. 'Ibe Pseudo-Aer. associated
it with the Ludi Seculares‚ nc. 17‚and it was accordingly treated by several
editors as an introduction to the Carm. Sec.

Franke assigns it to nc. 28, the year in which Augustus dedicated the temple to
Apollo on the Palatine (Od. 1. 31). and instituted the quinquennial Ludi Actiaci
in honour ol Apollo and Diana. He thinks the ode was written sor their first
celebration.

Orelli considers it a mere exercise of lancy, suggested perhaps by some such
occasion as the games ol rac. 28, but not ol sufficient weight to have been com·
posed t'or public performance. ⁶
