Wnnr the Greeks called α’ παρακλαυσῖθῳον. Other specimens moy be seen and
compared in Theoc. 3. 23 loll.. Propert. 1.1⁶.17s011. Cp. also Herone, Od. 1.
25. 6-8, 3. 7. 29f011.

The poet personatos a lover singing under his mistress’ window on n frosty
night, nnd appealing to her pity to let him in. ‘Venus will resent and punish your
pride; you have no right from your origin to give yoursell the nirs ol a Penelope.
Though no humnn feelings-grntitude. pity‚ jenlousy-will make you love me.

Compare with the Ode 4. 13, which seems to be the revenge which is here
threatened.
