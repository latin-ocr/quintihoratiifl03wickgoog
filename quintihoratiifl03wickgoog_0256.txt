ODE XVll.

cmm Introduction to 1. 26. The purpose of this Ode can only be guessed.
The introductory passage seems very much as if it was playful. lt traces Aelius
Lamia's pedigree to lamus, the Homeric king of the Laestrygones (Od. 10. 81 Ἐβ-

Horace writes the day before a holiday‚ possibly to Lamia at some country

to the mention of the sea-shore and to the genealogical introduction. as ifthe poet
