THE SCHOLIASTS. xxi

delects must actually have existed: it becomes a question of less or
more. But the antecedent probability of the suppositions which are
necessary to any theory of the interpolation of spurious Odes or parts
ol Odes cannot be so easily granted. Every known lact in the history
of Horace's poems can be explained without such a theory, unless
indeed it be assumed that no poem or stanza which lalls below his
highest poetical level can be genuine. On the other hand, as
Mr. Munro points out¹, in his vigorous summary ol the arguments
against the interpolation theory, the form ol Horace’s poems is
specially his own. We are asked to imagine that unknown poets‚
in the literary ageos Rome, reproduced it with a skill and complete-
ness oi which the known poets who have tried to imitate it proved
themselves incapable. The editors who have done the most lor the
interpretation of Horace in this generation (Orelli, Dillenburger,
Ritter) are the least disposed to allow oi any spurious poems or
passages in his text. But though Peerlkamp's method ol criticism
must be pronounced baseless, we may trace srom it, as lrom its pre·

decessor, indirect results ol value in the attention which it calls to the
sequence os thought, the lights and shades oi style, and the varying
meritos the poetry.

II. Ita Scholiasta.

· Tus collections oi Scholia on Horace which pass under the names
ol Helenius Acron, and Pomponius Porphyrion, can neither of them
be certainly dated, and some doubt therefore hangs over their relation
to one another, neither oi them is in a perlect state nor free from

. suspicion os interpolations. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, they

must be considered of very high value. On questions of text the
authority of the commentary is at the least several centuries older than
any MS. of the poet, either extant or known to us by testimony. Ol
course the ‘lemmata’ or quoted words. to which the comment is
affixed, areos inferior importance, and they differ not unlrequently
from the text interpreted in the commentary, and can only by them-
selves carry us back to the date ol the oldest MS. of the Scholia, viz.
at the earliest to centuries 9-10. On questions ol interpretation, and .
especially oi allusions to customs‚ sites, and persons, the Scholia have
value, independently ol any doubt as to their writer's precise date or
