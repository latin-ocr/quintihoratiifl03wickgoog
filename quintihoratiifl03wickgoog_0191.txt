HORATII CARlllNl'M

O DE XVll.

‘Kus me not, Maecenas. with your dismal iorebodings Is you are going to die.
ldie tco; so the gods will. and so 1 will. For mysels‚1 could not sunive the one
halt' os mysell: 1 have swom, and will be true to my cath os scalt„ where you go
1 will go. il the Chimaera or Gyas were to rise tc prevent it. And tle gods will
it too. Ilmownot whether 1 was born under a good star orabad one, but my
horoscope tallies wonderfully with yours. You recovered from dangerous illness

just when 1 escaped the falling tree. let us remember it. and in onr several ways
thanlr the gods?

Maecenas was an invalid (Plin. N. Η. y. 54 ‘Quibusdam perpetua lebris est
sicut C. Maecenati. Eidem triennio supremo nullo horae momento contigit som·
nus '), and one that cluug passionately to lile, it'we me'y trust his own lines
' preserved by Seneca, Epp. ror :-

‘Debilem facito manu,
Debilem pede, coxa,
Tuber adstrue gibberum.
Lubricos quate dentes;
vin dum superest¹ bene cstl
Hunc mihi vel acuta
si sedeam cruce, sustine?

He hasbeen complaining os his health to Horace, and the poet would coax him

out oi his hypochondriacal t'ears by the expressions oi affection, by the professions
ot' his own strong belief that Maecenas’ lile is as good as his own, by recalling his
previous recovery from illness and his flattering reception in the theatre, as
memories likely to strengthen his confidence in his destiny and in himself.

The astrological part ol the Ode is only an adoptation ol the language cla
popular superstition which Horace condemns in Od. r.11. Orelli points out that
the tanguage os stanza 5, ⁸ seu Libra seu: etc, t'orbids the idea that Horace had
confidence in any calculatiou ol his own horoscope. He tells us, Sat. 1. 6. 114,
that he was lond ol standing aud listoning to the astrologers cl the circus. With
the poet's professions οἱ his resolution not to survive Maecenas cp. Epcd. 1; on
Maecenas’ reception in the theatro, Od. 1. 203 und on Horace's own escape irorn
the falling tree. Od. a. 13.

Maecenas actually died in nc. 8, a lew months before Horace.

CUR me querelis exanimas tuis?
Nec dis amicum estnec mihi te prius
Obire, Maecenas, mearum
Grande decus columenque rerum.

2. ominum ort, φίλων ἐστί. decus meum! Cp. Epp. ι. 1. 103· Virg-
prius. sc. ‘quam me.’ G. a. 40.
