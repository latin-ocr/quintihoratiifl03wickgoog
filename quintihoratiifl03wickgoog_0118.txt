ODE XXVIII.

³ Ir it be essential to good drama that the dramatic play should be at least so
obvious that most intelligent readers should put the same interpretation upon it,
this Ode cannot be pronounced very successful. Its scene, its nature, the division
of the parts (if it is a dialogue), its purpose, are all points on which it would be
hard to find two editors who agree.

The question of the scene has been complicated by doubts which have been
raised as to the locality of the 'Matinum litus! The Scholiasta speak with an
uncertain voice. 'Mons Apuliae, sive ut quidam volunt plana Calabriae' is
Acron's note. Porph. calls it here ‘promontorium Apuliae'; on Epod. 16. 18
‘mons Calabriae! Ritter, arguing from this Ode, and pressing the identity of the
“ Matina apis' of Od. 4. a. 27 with the ‘Calabrae apes' of 3. 16. 33, and the Taren·
tine bees of a. 6. 14, places it near Tarentum, where it was natural that Archytas
should have been buried. The balance of evidence, however, is greatly in favour
of the more northern site. The 'Matina cacumina' of Epod. 16. 18 would seem
to have been part of rhe range of Mount Garganus. and the ‘litus Matinum' the
shore at their base. A village and port at this place is still called ·Mauiuata.·
Lucan, 9. 182, joins Vultur, Garganus, and ‘ calidi buxeta Matini: as all belonging
to Apulia. The Scholiasts' confusion arose more probably from the vagueness
with which the term ‘Calabria’ was employed in many writers. We must choose
then for the scene of the Ode between the ‘litus Matinum,' as thus explained, and
