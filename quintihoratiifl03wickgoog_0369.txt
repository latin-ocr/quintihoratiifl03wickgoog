GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO THE

EPODES.

‘Lrsun Eronos) ‘Liber vtus qui Epodon inscribitur,’ are the titles
by which this Book is headed in MSS, and cited by the grammatical
and metrical writers os the 4th and 5th centuries, Marius Victorinus,
Diomedes, Fortunatianus. The separate poerns are called Odae.
The word Epode (ἐπῳδός) was a recognized metrieal term sor the
shorter verse of a couplet, which is as it were the echo (ἐπᾴδεται,
‘accinitur ¹) ol the longer one, and then συνεκδοχικῶς sor the metre or
poem (more properly ‘carmen epodicum 'l in which such a sequence
occurred ¹. Elegiae verses are thus admitted as Epodic by Victorinus
(p. 2500), but ¹in common use the term was appropriated to the
couplet metres os Archilochus and their Horatian imitations. It
may be noticed that such metres are not peculiar to the so·called
‘Epodes’ Two oi the couplets known specially by Archilochus’ name
occur only in the Odes (ι. 4, and 4. 7), the latter is the one example
of an ‘Epodus’ quoted from Horace by Terentianus Maurus.

Horaee's own name ior these poems is ‘Iambi' (Epod. 14. 7, Od. r.
16. 3 and 24, Epp. 1. 19. 25), a term which implied their character at
least as much as their metre (cp. the Greek verb ἰαμβίζειν, and see
Arist. Poct. e. 4, 5, cp. Hor. A. P. 79 ‘Archilochum proprio rabies
armavit iambo ’).
