HORATII CARMINUM

ODE Vll.

‘Dou'r n'eep. Asterie, sor your absent Gyges. 'He will oome back to you with
the spring and bring aweolth ol Bithynian merchandize. He will come back:
he is only detained by the winter in the harbour to which he was driven on his
way home. He lies awalre at night thinking oi you. ‘Itis all invain that his
hostess Chloe tries every art to vin him. sends emissaries to tell him oi her
passion and to prove to him from mythology the solly oi oonstuncy; he turns
adeat ear to it all. Only mind you do aswells Your neighbour Enipeus isa
bravo young gallant, but don't open your window il he comesto serenade you’

As Orelli characterizes it, ‘arntiam mercatorum vitam amoresque lyrice descri-
bens· The names are Greek, the lise Roman. Ritter points out the effect oi this
Ode in relieving by its lightnsss and grace the seriousness oi the preceding six.
