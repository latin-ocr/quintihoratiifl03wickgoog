¹er man wilt thou sing of, Clio? what demigodt what god l-sing ot', till
the hill ol Helicon rings his name egeln, or the woods os Haemus follow to listen.
u they did when Orpheus sang? What god, but Jove first. and Palles next, Liber
Diana. Phoebus. For demigods. Hercules and the Twin Brethren who calm the
stormy sea And of men: Romulus and all the Roman worthies; Marcellus, the
lustre of whose name grows with euch generatiom the Julian house. which out·
shines ull others es the moon outshines the sters3 Angustus, the hope ol the
human racc. the vicegerent ot Jove himself?

The frameworlr oi the Ode is suggested by the opening ol Pind. 01. 2 :-

ὧαξιφόρμιγγα ὕμνοι
τίνα θεόν, τίν’ ἥρω, τίνα δ’ ἄνδρα seneliacum

But aller the question has been asked the resemblance censes. ln Pindar it is
answered immediately: ‘The god is Zeus, the hero Hercules, the man Theron·
end ull three are directly connected with the Olympinn victory which Theron

The arguments as to the latest time at which it can hare been written or
published seem irresistible. lt cannot have been alter Marcellus' untimely death
in the autumn ol nc. 23. The earliest dete is commonly fixed by his marriage with
Julis in nc. 25, when Augustus adopted him as his son. The Ode links his name
too closely to the Julian house to have been written before Augustus had given
tinel eud unmistekuble prooss ot his intentions towards him.
