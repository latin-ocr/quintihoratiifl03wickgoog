epoch common to the others'

ᾗ 2. The second It'mr'l, the latest date at which the Three Books asa
whole can have been published, is fixed mainly by the reference in
Od. 1. 12. 45-48. Marcellus died in the autumn of uc. 23· lt isin·
conceivable that these lines should be (as Ritter suggests) a complimen-
tary allusion to one already dead ; an assurancc to Augustus that at
least the fame of his son-in·law survived: all that the author of the
dirge on Quintilius could offer to match Virgil's ‘Tu Marcellus erisl
And it is almost equally impossible that, written before his early
death, they should have been published (as from other considerations
it would be necessary to conclude) within a year or two of that great
disappointment of the hopes of Rome and of the Emperor.

An argument, second only in weight to this, is founded upon the
Odes (2. ro and 3. 19) which have reference to Licinius Murena, the
brother of Terentia, Maecenas' wife (see also on Od 2. a. 5). Murena
was executed for participation with Fannius Caepio in a conspiracy
against Augustus in tac. aa. The presumption seems very strong
that even if Horace’s feelings would have allowed him to publish these
poems, and especially Od. a. 10, after his friend’s catastrophe, he
would have been deterred by the knowledge that the reminiscences
must be displeasing to Maecenas as well as to Augustus. Frauke
recalls the story of Virgil's striking out the praises of Gallus from
the end of Georg. ivon somewhat similar grounds

The arguments for postponing the publication of the Odes to a
later date are not such as can really be set against these con·
sideratious. They turn mainly on Od. 1. 3, which is taken to refer
to the voyage of Virgil to Athens in the last year of his life, tac. 19:
and on the supposed allusious (the strongest case is Od. a. 9) to the
expedition of Tiberius into Armenia, and the restoration of the
standards by the Parthians in uc. ao. Some remarks on these points
will be found in the Introductions to Od. 1. 3 aud a. 9. There re-
mains the possibility that these (and if these, then other) Odes may
have been inserted after the first publication. It will be seen that this
is not likely to have been the case with 1. 3; and the theory of any
such insertione is perhaps hardly compatible with that pause in lyric
composition between the publication of Books i-iii aud the com·
mencement of Book iv, which is implied in Suetonius' statement, and
in Horace's own words, Od. 4. 1. r, Epp. 1. 1. 1-10.
