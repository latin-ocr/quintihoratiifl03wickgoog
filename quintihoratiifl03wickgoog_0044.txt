ODES, BOOKS Ι-ΙΙΙ. 7

super urbe euras,' ‘Tu civitatem quis deceat status Cura-s, et urbi
sollicitus times! These expressions have been usually interpreted of
the powers which Augustus is known to have delegated to Maecenas
during his own absence from Rome in the last year of the civil war.
Dio 51. 3, Tac. Ann. 6. rr ‘Augustus bellis civilibus Cilnium Mae·
cenarem equestris ordinis cunctis apud Romam atque Italiam prae·
posuit' If the later date of these Odes were adopted it would seem
necessary to assume, what is probable enough in itself, but not other·
wise ascertained, that the same powers were entrusted to Maecenas
during Augustus' absence in Gaul and Spain in the years nc. 27-24.

II.—THE ORDER OF THE ODES.

ξ 9. In the preceding pages it has been assumed that the first three
Boolrs of the Odes were published together. This is not a necessary ¹
inference from Suetonius’ words3 all that we know from him being
that three Boolrs had been published before the fourth was corn·
menced. But if we may assume that the present division of Odes
between the Books is the original division, it will follow that the
publication of the three mnst have been simultaneous, not successive,
for, whatever be the principle of the arrangement of the Books‚ it
certainly is not chronological ¹. For this reason, then, if for no other,
it may be a matter of some interest to see the evidence in favour of
the present order of the Odes.

ξ 10. ln the first place, it has at least the right of undispnted tradi-
tional possession. One MS. indeed, and that the important Berne MS,
ignores the division into Books‚ and to some extent rearranges the
Odes3 but we may notice (α) that the Fourth Book (which certainly
was separate), and even the Epodes‚ are treated in the same way as
the Odes of Boolu i-iii; (b) that a purpose can be probably assigned
