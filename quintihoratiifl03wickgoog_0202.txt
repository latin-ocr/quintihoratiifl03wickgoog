LIB. 11. OD. 20.

Dilecte‚ Maecenas, obibo
Nec Stygia cohibebor unda.
Iam iam residunt cruribus asperae
Pelles, et album mutor in alitem
Supeme‚ nascunturque leves
Per digitos humerosque plumae.
Iam Daedaleo notior Icaro
Visam gementis litora Bospori
Syrtesque Gaetulas canorus
’ Ales Hyperboreosque campos.
Me Colchus et qui dissimulat metum
Marsae cohortis Dacus et ultimi
Noscent Geloni, me peritus
Discet Hiber Rhodanique potor. ιο
Absint inani sunere neniae
Luctusque turpes et querimoniae;
Compesce clamorem ac sepulcri
Mitte supervacuos honores.
