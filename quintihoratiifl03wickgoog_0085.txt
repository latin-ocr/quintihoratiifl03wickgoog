HORATII CARhlINUM

Fervens difficili bile tumet iecur.
Tum nec mens mihi nec color

Certa sede manent, humor et in genas
Furtim labitur, arguens

Quam lentis penitus macerer ignibus.
Uror, seu tibi candidos

Turparunt humeros immodicae mero
Rheae, sive puer furens

Impressit memorem dente labris notam. ,.
Non, si me satis audias,

Speres perpetuum, dulcia barbare
Laedentem oscula, quae Venus

Quinta parte sui nectaris imbuit.
Felices teret amplius,

Quos irrupta tenet copula nec malis
Divolsus querimoniis

Suprema citius solvet amor die. ια
