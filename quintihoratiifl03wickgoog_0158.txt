LIB. 11. OD. 4. 121

And possibly the Ode refers to some real person. although the name be fictitious.
Tm irony would be wasted on a shadow; and there is e definiteness both in the
name ol the ‘Phocion' Xanthias and in the introductiones Horace’s own person·
nlity (stanza 6), which is more dramatic then is usual in the purely imaginery
Odes. It is undoubtedly Horace’s way to edd a local designation to fictitious
characters: ‘Cnidius Gyges.’ Od. a. 5. ποι ‘liparaei nitor liebri: 3, rs. 6. In
some cases, as in ‘Thurini Calais filius Omyti.' 3. 9. 14. the appearance os com·

a greater semblanoe of reality. 'lhe purpose here is the less easy to imagine, f10¹1¹
the fact that the name is addressed to xanthios himself, not used by way os iden·
titying him to others. li the lover os the Ode was a real person, there mny of
course be some play in the name. of which the point is lost to us. Orelli suggests
that ‘Xanthias' may be chosen to cover a Roman ‘Flavius'cp Od. 3· 15· 11,
where he thinks ‘Nothus' may represent a real 'Spurius' Ritter imagines a
Greek resident in Rome. and. comparing Od. r. ²7· ro ¹ Megillae frater Opuntiae‚'
ingeniously suggests that the person there mllied is none other than Xanthias, and
that the ‘Phyllis' of this Ode is the ‘Charybdis' ol thet3 see Introd. to 1. ²⁷·

The composition os the Ode is fixed by y. ²4 to the end oi Horace's sortieth
year, nc. ²⁵·
