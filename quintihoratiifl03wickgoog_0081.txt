HORATII CARhlINUM

Arte materna rapidos morantem
Fluminum lapsus celeresque ventos,
Blandum et auritas fidibus canoris
Ducere quercus. ’
Quid prius dicam solitis parentis
Laudibus, qui res hominum ac deorum,
Qui marcac terras variisque mundum
Temperat horis?
Unde nil maius generatur ips0‚
Nec viget quidquam simile aut secundum:
Proximos illi tamen occupavit
Pallas honores.
Proeliis audarqlneque te silebo
Liber et saevis inimica Virgo
