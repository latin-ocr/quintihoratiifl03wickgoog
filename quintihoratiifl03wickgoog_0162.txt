LIB. ΙΙ. OD. 6.

ODE VI.

‘Serriuma my dear friend who would accompany me to the ends of the earth,
let me spend the eud of my life at Tibur, or if not there, then at Tarentum. Let us
go there together and live there till 1 die!

Septimius has been naturally supposed to be thesaure person whom Horace
introduces to Tiberius in Epp. 1. 9. The Schol. Cruq. further identihes him with
Titius, the poet on the staff of the same Tiberius in Epp. 1. 3. 9 ‘Romana brevi
venturus in ora, Pindarici fontis qui non expalluit haustus? It may probably be the
same person who is named as the common friend of the poet and the emperor in
Augustus’ letter preserved in the Suetonian life of Horace.

This is one of the Odes which is assigned by several of Horace’s chronologists
toadate earlier than ac. 31 (see Introd. to Books i-iii. 5 a). We must not, perhaps.
lay very much stress ou the fact that the year ²9 is the earliest time at which we
know of publio attention being called to the difficulty of snbduing the Cantabri (v. a);
but the positive arguments for the early date seem slight. If the words ‘lasso
maris et viarum militiaeque¹ are to be presaed (see note on v. ι), they would carry
the Ode back not only beyond 31· but to a time when Horace was really fresh
from his campaign, and before he could well have beoonm familiar with Tibur aud
Tarentum. Macleane justly remarks that the tone of the Ode is not that of a
young adventures freshly oome to Rome to begin life. Nor is the argument
stronger from the supposed incompatibility of his roving tastes with his pos·
sessiou of the 'unica Sabina,' which he obtained iu no. 34. Cp. his language ln
Ep. 1. 7. 44 ‘mihi non tam regia Roma Quam vacuum Tibur placet aut imbelle
Tarentum’
