ODE XXIX.

‘Wrrnr⁸ Iccius hanlrering aiter the treasures os Arabia. and planning eastern
conquestsl Have you chosen already ¹your share oi the spoil? Who will say
again that aught in nature is impossible, when Iccius the scholar sells his library
to buy armour and belles the promise ol his liiel’

Iccius is unknown to us except from this Ode arrd Epp. t. 12. In that Epistle.
written probably about five years afterwards, he has resumed his ‚peaceful pursuits‚

We must not take Horace's banter here or his imputation oi avaricions motives as
serious. Some readers see in the opening lines oi the Epistle a hint ol restlessncss

liie and a rare example ol the possibility os maintaining a pure and loity taste
‘inter scabiem et contagia lucri!

In the year ²4 ac. Aelius Gallus made an unsuccessinl expedition into Arabia
Felix. The Ode will probably have been written when the preparations ior it
had begun, but these seem to have lasted some time; see on Od. r. 35. 3ο.
