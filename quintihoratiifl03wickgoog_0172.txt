ODE X.

‘Tua wise sailor is neither tempted too far out to sea nor frightened on to rocks
and shallows. One who has learnt to love the golden mean neither has a huvel
witha roof falling in nor a palace that would attract the evil eye. The higher the
seat the greater the fall. The wise man is prepared for fortune to change like
everything else. Be braye and hopeful if things are against you, and so. too, do
not spread all your sails because the wind chauces to be favourable.'

Horace recommends moderatiori of life and manners. Professedly it is a meon
that he praises; bnt it is clear throughout that it is excess that he deprecates; the
danger of defect is uot really before his mind. This is shown in the first part of
the Ode by omission—the hypothesis would require a stanna corresponding to st. 3
to illustrate the danger of being too low, as that illustrates the danger of being too
high-in the second part by the stress laid on the altemative least contemplated,
under cover of which the poet at last ventures to put plainly the lesson on which
his heart is really set.

The person to whom the Ode is addressed is the sameas the ‘augur Murena' of
Od. 3. ¹9· 11 (see also Sat. 1. 5. 38). He is variously called ‘Lucius Murena'
(Veli. Pat. a. 91). ‘Licinius Murena' (Dio Cass. 54. 3), ‘Varro Murena· (Suet.
Tib. 8), and he is said by Dio (l. c.) to have been the brother of Terentia, the
wife of Maecenas. There is one of Cioero's friends who is called A. Varro (ad
Fam. 160 12, see note in Watson's Select letters, p. 305) and Varro Murena (ad
Fam. 13. aa). The friend of Horace has been sometimes identified with the friend
of Cicero, sometimes taken to be his son. The double set of names must imply
that their bearer. or. if there were two, the elder bearer of them, had passed by
adoption from one ‘gens‘ to the other.

The ‘Murena’ oi Horace had been employed by Augustus in nc. ²5· in the sub·
jugation of the Salassi. the inhabitants of the Val d'Aosta‚ and had been namedjas
