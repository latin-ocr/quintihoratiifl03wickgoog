ODE XXXV.-v

Tm Fortuna of this Ode, as bas been already suggested. is a different conception
from that of the last. She is the author of the vicissitudes of lire, but not in sport
(as in Od. 3. 29. 49). or at random, as the blind chance-goddess. The apparent

Palatine and crossed the Tiber, she laid aside her wings and took off ber sendus
and left behind her hall. tbe symbol of fickteness and change!
