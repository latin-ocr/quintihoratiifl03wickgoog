COMPLEMENTARY INFINITIVE. 381

perire,’ ‘piger serre': it may cause some ambiguity when the negative
character of the adjective is less clear, or where it would have been
equally open to the poet to regard it from its positive side, and to
make the infinitive the complement of the whole, not merely os the
positive part, via the attribute denied or disparaged. Contrast, e. g,
‘ferre iugum pariter dolosi' with ‘cautum dignos assumere,' ‘ealli-
dum condere‚' etc.; (b) in such cases as the last three given above,
where the adjective and the infinitive seem to have changed placeo,
where it is no longer an internal quality os the subject leading to some
action, butan action which is the cause or ground os the attribute, no
longer ‘brave so as to conquer,' but ‘famous because he conquers!

‘Niveus videri,' Od. 4. 2. 59 (like ‘nefas videre,’ Epod. 16.14),
seems to be more purely an imitation oi a Greek idiom (λεῦκος ὁρᾶσθαι,
ἀθέμιτον ἰδεῖν).
