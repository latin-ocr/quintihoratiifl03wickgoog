240 HORATII CARMINUM

ODE XXV.

lv this ode. as in a. 19, Horace hus tried to catch the inspiratiou of a Greek
dithyramh. Iu that one he professes to recall the effeets which the sight oi
Bacchus had upon him: in the present one he is actually under the influeuce of
the afflatus. ‘He is hurried away, whither he knows not: his eyes ure opened on
strange caverns and river-henim and woods. His tongue will be loosed in a
moment to sing no humble theme, and in no common stram, the glories of Caesar:
he follows the god, sor he must. and it is delightIul but it is fearsul too!

The glory oi Caesar is only mentioned as the subject os the coming burst oi
song; but the place os honour given to it is in effect the celebration which is
promised. See 1. 6, Introd.

Metre- third Asclepiad.
