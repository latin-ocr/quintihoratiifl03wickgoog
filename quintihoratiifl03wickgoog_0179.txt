ODE Xlll.

Tus thoughts suggested by the fall os a tree ou his Sabine sarm from which
Horace narrowly escaped. For other allusions to the incident see Od. a. 17· η,
3. 4. 27, 3. 8. 8; and on the date oi all the Odes which refer to it see Introd. to

Booksi iii, ᾖ 8.

The poem begins with a burst os indignation, at least half humorous (comp.
Epod. 3), at the unluclry tree and the wretch that planted it. Then, from the
mention (v. η) of the accident that had so nearly overwhelmed him, rises the
thought, ‘How little we guess the quarter from which danger really threatens us.
We fix our eyes on some one risk and sear that only, but death comes to all the
world irom the quarter they do not expect? Nost, suggested by the ‘leti Vis
rapuit rapietque‚' comes the remembranoe how very neor to death he has been
‘how near seeing Proserpine and Aeacus on his seat os judgment and the separate
abode os happy souls, among thern’ (here comes the last change) ‘those whom the
lyric poet would first look sor. Sappho and Alcaeus. An admiring throng os
shades is round both. but the larger and the more attentive round Alcaeus What
wonder il they hstes, when even Cerberus is spell-bound, and Prometheus and
Tantalus sorget their paics, aud Orion stays from his hunting to hear.'

Quicunque primurn, et sacrilega manu

ol Horace's indignation is theman that which Α. Gellius notices (Noct. Att.

fitly in the place os emphasis in both to those which were interdicted sor
