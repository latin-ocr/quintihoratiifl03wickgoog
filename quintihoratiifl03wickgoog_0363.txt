CARMEN SECULARE.

..——.—-———----

‘Pnoeaor aud Diana, grant the prayers duly offered at this sacred season (v.
1-8).

0 sumeret changing yet ever the same, let Rome’s preeminence be as change-
less (v. 9·¹²)·

Diana, birth goddess, guard our mothers (v. 13-16).

Bless our new marriage laws to the increase os our people, that each “seculum ”
may find us still celebrating this festival (v. 17-24).

ODesrinies, sullil the happy oracles, and add future to past blessings; fertility
ol earth and cattle; seasouable rain and pure air (v. ²5·³²)·

Apollo, hear us boys (v. 33, 34).

Diana, hear us girls (v. 35, 36).

Π Rome is your creation, the temnant saved srorn Troy sor Aeneas' piety, give
our youth Aeneas’ manners, and our old men his happy old age. Give Rome all
blessings (v. 37-48).

And grant the prayers now offered by Aeneas' great son. He has subdued
the Mede, the Scyth, the lndiau. He has restored peaoe aud virtue and plenty
(v. satio)-

Phoebus, pleased with his Palatino temple, promises another lustrum and ln·
creasing years os prosperity (v. 61-68).

Diana listens to the ⁴⁸ quindecimviri‚“ and the chorus oi boys and girls ; and all
the gods approve audjoin in their blessing' (v. 69-76).

That there was some division ol parts between the male and female singers
seems probable on the iaoe os the Ode, and the Sibylline verses (v. ao) seem
to spealr definitely oi such a division. It is not so easy to see what the division
was. Steiner otranges the Ode as follows :-

Str. 1. a, pmodur, boys and girls together.

str.3 4 str. 9 mesodus' str. 10 ' 11
5}boys6]girls vv.1,2b0ys 12}boys13}girls
7 8 sraifls 14 15
str. 16-19, epodus, boys and girls together.

Ritter amends this arrangement by assigning 10-12 to the boys, 13-15 to the
girls; 16 to the boys, answered to by 17 from the girls. Then iu 18 the girls
begin, and would be answered in a similar way by the boys, but this is changed into
a final strophe by the united choir.

There ure obvious difficulties iu the way os both.
