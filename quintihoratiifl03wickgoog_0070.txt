ODE VII.

Tur natural meaning of the Ode is, ‘The world is full of fair spots, but your
own Tibur is the fairest· Forget your troubles. Plancus; in camp, or here in
Tibur, drown care in wine. Remember how Teucer put a bold face on his
calamity‚ and found a new Salamis to make up for the old!

tthat Plancus’ trouble was we do not know, nor whether it bore any resem·
blance to Teucer’s by involving a compulsory absence from his well-lovecl Tibur.

L. Munatius Plancus was a man of no character. ‘morbo proditor,’ Vell. Pat. a.
⁸³· He hail been a friend of Julius Caesam after his death he changed sirlcs
more than once between Antony and Octavius. By the latter he was made consul
mac. 4²·

With the story of Teucer at the end of the Ode compare the conclusion of
Epod. 13, 11 ad fin.

Several of the best MSS. begin a new Ode at v. ¹5· The division was as old ns
Porph.. for he notices and condemns ξω on v. 15 ‘Hanc Oden qiidam putant aliam
esse, sed eadem est3 nam et hic ad Plancum loquitur cuius iu honorem ot iu supe-
riore parte Tibur laudavit, Plancus enirn inde fuit oriundus! There seems too
little substance in the first fonrteen lines for a separate Ode. and the recurrence to
Tibur in v. ao is clearly the lint. though a slight one. Mistakes in the matter are
common ln the MSS. See Epod. a. 23 and 9. 27. Porph. mentions rntl condemns
a division of Od. 3. ²4 at v. ²5· though it is not so found in any extant MS. The
opposite mistalre occurs in Od. 2. ¹4· ¹5· which are w. itten continuously in several
of the oldest MSS.. although there is no conceivable connection between them.
