Au editor ⁸whose knowledge of MSS. is almost entirely at
second-hand owes some apology, at least to himself, lor dis·
cussing questions oi text ; but he can hardly avoid such discussion. '
Even if he chooses an existing text as his guide throughout, he
must by his choice virtually take a side in many intricate questions,
and he does so in the way which is the least instructive to his reader,
by appearing to settle without discussion questions which are really
open Happily the text oi Horace is one in which, it' some points
must always remain in uncertainty‚ the uncertainty is os a very bear-
able kind. The worst result of a bad judgment will usually be only
to prefer the least probable oi two readings, either of which has much
to say lor itsell, makes good sense, and has been supported by great
scholars.

It will be seen that the MSS. ol Horace, though very numerous,
are not very ancient There are none, like the uncial MSS. ol Virgil,
os palmary authority. There are a considerable number which are
placed between the end ol the 9th and roth centuries; only one now
extant which belongs undoubtedly to the 9th. In addition to these,
we have the testimony of Cruquius (see below), at whatever value
it is to be rated, to the readings of a MS. probably some two
centuries earlier, and we have Scholia which are generally believed to
date, at least in their original sonu, from the 3rd to the 5th century.

Occasionally, where doubt hangs over the form oi some salient
expression in Horace, we find light thrown upon it by more or less
certain imitations of it in Ovid, or in the later Roman poets. Lastly,
