136 HORATII CARlllINUh‘I

(Dio 54. 3), of a conspiracy with Fannius Caepio, and, in spite of the efforts of
·Procu1eius‚his brother (see on Od. a. a. 5), and Maecenas, his brother-in·law'
(Dio l. c.)‚ was put to death. ln the character given of him (ἀκράτῳ καὶ κατακορεΐ
παρρησίᾳ πρὸς rdrrur duola· ἐχρῆτο, see Dio l. c.. who tells a story of his boldness
of speech towards Augustus himself) we may probably see the appropriateness of

Horace's persuasive to moderatior.
On the argument drawn from this Ode as to the date of the publication of the

three Books, see introd to Books iiii, 5 a.

RECTIUS vives, Licini, neque altum

Semper urgendo neque, dum procellas

Cautus horrescis, nimium premendo
Litus iniquum.

Auream quisquis mediocritatem

Diligit, tutus caret obsoleti

Sordibus tecti, caret invidenda
Sobrius aula.

Saepius ventis agitatur ingens

Pinus et celsae graviore casu

Decidunt turres feriuntque summos
Fulgura montes.

Sperat infestis, metuit secundis

Alteram sortem bene praeparatum

Pectus. Informes hiemes reducit
Iuppiter, idem
