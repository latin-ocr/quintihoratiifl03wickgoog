LIB. III. OD. 21.

ODE XXI.

Warrrru in anticipation of entertaining M. Valerius Messalla Corvinus. Dillr.
bids us compare with this Ode Epp. 1. 5.

‘Cask of Massia, as old as myself, your potent contenis were kept for some
happy occasion. and they shall be broached to-day for Corvinus. He, philosopher
as he is. will not despise you. Old Cato. they tell us, did not object to a cup of
wine. You make genius flow; you give fresh hope to the anxious and contage to
the poor. With your help. and Liber aud Venus and the Graces, we will keep the
banquet up till daylight.'

Corvinus (the ‘Messalla' of Sat. 1. 6. 4²· 1. ro. 85, Α. Ρ. 371 ‘diserti Mes·
sallae’) was, lilre Pollio, at once distinguished in the political and the literary
world. He had belonged to the senatorian party, and turned Octavius' flaui< in
the first day’s fighting at Philippi. He subsequently joined Octavius against
Antouy. and commanded the oentre of his flectat Actium. After the settlement
he retired from active life, and devoted himself to oratory and literature. He was
the great friend and patron of Tibullus.

With the fourth and fifth stanzas should be compared On‘d's imitation, A. A. 1.
237 foll:-

‘Vina parant animos faciuntque caloribus aptose
Cura fugit, multo diluiturque mero.
Tunc veniunt risus, tunc pauper cornua sumit;
Tunc dolor et curae rugaque frontis abit:
Tunc aperit mentes aevo rarissima nostro
Simplicitas, artes excutiente deo';

and the fragment of Maecenas’ ‘Symposium,' which Ritter quotes from Servius on
the words ‘faciles oculos' in Virg. Aen. 8. 310: ‘lloc . . etiam Maecenas in Sym·
posio cui Vergilius et Horatius interfuerunt, cunr ex persona Messallae de vino
loqueretur. ait: idam humor ministrat faciles oculos, pulchriora reddit omnia, et dulcis
iuventae reducit barra!
