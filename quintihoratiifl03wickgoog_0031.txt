[Of the origin of the ‘cognomen' nothing can be guessed. The
‘nomen' might imply that his father, on manumission, had taken a
gentile name from some member of the Horatia gens. Itis now
. more generally believed, on a suggestion of G. F. Grotefend, that it
was derived from the Horatia tribus, the one of the country tribes in
which the colony of Venusia was enrolled, and to which Horace's
father, as a libertus of Venusia, would belong]

actor exactionum,' ‘a collector of taxes! He says, further, that
