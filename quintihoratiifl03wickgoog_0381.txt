LIBER. EPOD. 4. 337

mention oi the fickleuess and treachery ol Menas, has been thought to fix the date ⁸

os the Epode, ii it refers to him, to the period between his first desertion of Sextus
Pompeius and his retum to his service in 36. Yet during that time hc was serviug
with the fleet which he had carried over to Octavianus' side; and, though he may
have visited Rome, he can hardly have becorm as familiar a sight to the Roman
populace as is implied by vv. 11-16. The ollice ol 'tribunus militum· seems also
a strange one to be selected (Horace would choose the highest that he filled) for the
commander ol a lieet. Several MSS. including B and A, head the Epode with the
words¹Ad Sextum Menam libertinum. Vedium Rufum ex servitute miratur usur·
passe equestrem dignitatern usquead tribunatum militum.¹ with no sign that the
two inscriptions are inconsistent oraltemative; a common mistake‚ which seems to
lead us back to some common authority oi greater antiquity. ot the two names
offered, Menas was a likelyguess to any one who knew the history ol the rime, and
therefore carries with it less probability than the entirely unknown name oi Vedius
Rufus, to which there was nothing in the text or in the generally known histories
to lead a copyist or annotator. Orelli shows from an inscription that Rufus is
found among the cognomina oi the Vedii.
